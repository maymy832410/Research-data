	abstract = {With the continuous development of science and technology, people have begun to interact with computer equipment, and human–computer interaction has become more and more simple. The human–computer interaction page is very user-friendly, people can communicate with the machine naturally, and can send signals through touch or gestures. In the process of person-to-person communication, gestures are a very common method that can convey specific signals. If you want to use gestures to send signals in human–computer interaction, you need to use the knowledge of computer vision to pave the way for human–computer interaction. We can deploy a teaching platform on the network platform to guide the teaching of English, which has become one of the teaching methods in many schools. In our school's research, we have incorporated some multimedia teaching in the English classroom teaching, and use multimedia teaching to stimulate students' interest in learning and improve their learning efficiency. We have changed the traditional teaching mode, through the way of human–computer interaction, using people's body movements and gesture information to interact. We also use AI technology to obtain the feature value of the vector angle through the three-dimensional characteristics of people's bones, and propose a KNN rapid recognition method. When constructing the English teaching system, we used the popular SSH framework and the C/S structure to design, and then we used design patterns to realize the reusability of the software. Finally, we conducted performance tests and functional tests on the system. The results show that this system can assist English teaching and can meet the needs of teaching. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a computer-based frequency distribution analysis to decode the pragma-stylistic meanings in one of the narrative discourse represented by Orwell’s dystopian novel Animal Farm. The main objective of the paper is to explore the extent to which computer software contribute to the linguistic analysis of texts. The paper uses the variable of frequency distribution analysis (FDA) generated by concordance software to decode the pragmatic and stylistic significance beyond the mere linguistic expressions employed by the writer in the selected data. Some words were selected to undergo a frequency distribution analysis so as to highlight their pragmatic and linguistic weight which, in turn, helps arrive at a comprehensive understanding of the thematic message intended by the writer. The paper is grounded on one analytical strand: Frequency distribution analysis conducted by concordance. Results reveal that applying a frequency distribution analysis to the linguistic analysis of large data fictional texts serves to (i) identify the various types of discourse in these texts; (ii) create a thematic categorization that is based on the frequency distribution analysis of specific words in texts; and (iii) indicate that not only high frequency words are indicative in the production of particular pragmatic and stylistic meanings in discourse, but also low frequency words are highly indicative in this regard. These results accentuate a further general finding that computer software contribute significantly to the linguistic analysis of texts, particularly those pertaining to literature. The paper recommends further and intensive incorporation of computer and CALL (computer-assisted language learning) software in teaching and learning literary texts in EFL (English as a foreign language) settings. © 2022, (IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

Prior to the experiment, all participants undertook the same level test (pre-test) in order to assess their initial knowledge level of English. After finishing the learning stage, a post-test was provided to the students to assess their learning. In both groups, results in the post-test were consistently better than in the pre-test, supporting the positive effect of the learning software as an instructional tool. In addition, learning gains were significantly higher in the experimental group, that used the proposed instructional aids. IEEE},

Background: There is a need for longitudinal studies of the flipped classroom approach in general. Although a few cross-sectional studies show that a flipped classroom approach can increase student learning by providing more time for other in-class activities, such as active learning, such studies are also rare in the context of teaching software engineering. Intended Outcomes: To assess the usefulness of a flipped classroom approach in teaching software engineering. Application Design: The study was conducted at an international master's program in Sweden, given in English, and partially replicated at a university in Africa. Findings: The results suggest that students' academic success, as measured by their exam grades, can be improved by introducing a flipped classroom to teach software engineering topics, but this may not extend to their subjective liking of the material, as measured by student evaluations. Furthermore, the effect of the change in the teaching methodology was not replicated when changing the teaching team.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {During the last years, computers have changed the way people live and work. There is no field in which computers do not play a very important role. Education also has grown beyond learning from textbooks. Computer-Based Education refers to teaching methodologies using computers as a key component of information transmission. The paper presents different computer-based tools applied in the course "Telecommunication Security", included as compulsory in the curriculum of the specialty "Internet and Mobile Communications" for Bachelors at the University of Ruse but it can be applied in other courses covering topics of cryptography and information protection. During the classes students develop an application in MS Excel illustrating the principle of operation of a cryptosystem based on non-linear feedback shift registers generating de Bruijn Sequence, built on the basis of a 3-bit shift register and additional logic gates. Then the students implement the device studied using Logisim, an educational tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits and they can see the operation of the real device. The paper describes MS EXCEL-based applications implementing and graphically illustrating the processes of encryption and decryption of words in English using cryptosystems based on non-linear feedback shift registers (NLFSRs) generating de Bruijn Sequence. Numerous examples obtained by the applications are presented in the paper. Details about the functions used for the implementation are given. Some problems that arise when encrypting and decrypting texts are illustrated by examples. The application helps the teacher in the process of generating individual assignments for the students and facilitates the lecturer in checking the students' works. In groups with a higher number of students, the application might be used by students to check their works or the works of their colleagues. The topic could be presented in an accessible manner for pupils in the schools, without using the terminology required for students with the aim to attract future students to our university. Using active learning during the classes in the course, the lecturer understands the students who learnt the new lesson and the students who did not. Student self-assessment implicates students in evaluating their own work and learning progress. Using self-assessment, students can identify their own skill gaps and see where to focus their attention in learning, revise their work and track their own progress. This process helps students stay involved and motivated and encourages self-reflection and responsibility for their learning. © 2020, National Defence University - Carol I Printing House.

The goal of college English education is to enable them to communicate effectively in English in their future academic, work, and social interactions, while also developing students' self-learning skills. Chinese society improves overall cultural competence and adapts to the needs of international communication. Self-directed learning is not static and will increase or decrease with time, discipline, and conditions and is an evolving process. Understanding learning, taking responsibility for one's own learning, and learning how to learn are all beneficial. Students abound in school life and even throughout their lives. In this paper, we try to propose a computer-based method for constructing an independent English learning model based on a practical study of computer network technology for the development of self-learning ability of non-English majors in a university. This paper uses comparative analysis techniques to compare traditional paper-and-pencil examinations and computer-based online evaluations and analyzes the effects of each. The survey showed that 81% of the students preferred the computer-based assessment. Therefore, the focus of this research is to strengthen the oral English training in college and create an authentic English learning environment for students to really feel the standard English pronunciation, intonation, and knowledge of grammar, listening, reading, writing, and translation. © 2022 Mijuan Tian et al.},

The question of whether inductive learners make more progress than deductive learners was also addressed. A total of fifty-one non-English majors in a freshman English class participated in the study. Five computer-based and four paper-based DDL lessons were developed to increase students’ awareness of the usage of particular grammar items and the distinction between three sets of synonyms. In order to determine the effects of the treatments, all the participants took pre-tests and immediate posttests. The results showed that there was a statistically significant difference between pre-and post-tests on grammar and vocabulary. However, inductive learners did not outperform deductive learners. As for students’ perception of the treatments, it is noteworthy that they tended to take a neutral to less than positive attitude towards this DDL experience even though such an experience helped them significantly improve. The results suggested the existence of a gap between students’ perceived satisfaction and their actual achievement. Pedagogical implications of these findings were discussed to improve the efficacy of DDL in Taiwan’s EFL context. © 2023, Crane Publishing Co.. All rights reserved.},

The advantage of CBT over paper-based testing (PBT) is that it allows us to control the order of questions and provides test takers with continuous tasks capturing their thought processes. Additionally, their response process data such as response time (RT) can be obtained. Taking advantage of these, we created a CBT prototype in the classroom for Japanese junior high school students. Case description: A CBT model was created to assess integrated reading and writing ability and was administered to 32 junior high school students. Their process achievement and the relation between the process response and writing quality were analyzed. Students’ RT for each screen was analyzed using hierarchical cluster analysis. Discussion and evaluation: We identified not only students facing difficulties at each stage of a series of thought processes but also five clusters that include students spending too much time reading source texts or organizing their ideas. We suggest how CBT can be developed to identify students with difficulties and applied to teaching. Conclusions: CBT has the possibility of detecting students who are able to complete the language performance task by controlling the order of answers, asking questions sequentially, and obtaining RT effectively. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {With the change of English teaching methods, English examination methods have gradually changed from paper examination to computer examination. The online scoring of oral English test is more in line with the needs of teaching reform, and how to score online reasonably is more important. At present, the domestic scoring system technology for Chinese has been quite perfect, and the international scoring method technology for spoken English is not mature. Even if some scoring systems evaluate the scores, there are still some doubts about the accuracy of the scores. In view of the above background and the needs of English proficiency test teaching reform, this paper mainly studies the scoring method of College English online computer-based oral test. At present, most of the scoring methods of spoken English at home and abroad are based on HMM model, which gives a simple machine probability score through the training of corpus, but does not give an objective and specific score. The scoring method of parameter comparison mainly reflects the difference between standard spoken English and standard spoken English, which can not represent the specific score. In view of the above problems, based on the existing achievements and technologies, this paper studies the scoring method of College English online computer-based oral test. © 2023, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the advances of information and communication technologies (ICT) have stimulated the development of more effective and interesting approaches for teaching and learning at universities around the world. The educational innovations have stimulated the creative development for interactive technologies in various forms, for example, integrated learning systems, intelligent tutoring systems, computer-based instruction, computer aided assessment and computer mediated communication. These new concepts show that the advance in the digital era has expanded the learning process and has enabled higher levels of learner interactions in order to make learning more meaningful for overcoming the shortages in traditional learning. With reference to the advances in ICT and information growth, the delivery of knowledge needs to be more flexible in connecting the learners with the learning resources to support the independent and self-managed learning. Educators are trained to transform from the conventional teacher-centred approach to student-centred learning approach with technology-based learning environment which can better motivate students to participate and interact with others in the learning process for enhancing the quality of learning and encouraging students to demonstrate their understanding in the learning activities. ICT in education are applied in the form of interactive multimedia, which provides facilities to students to learn the material. The use of interactive multimedia applications in learning will improve the efficiency, motivation, thinking and logic abilities and facilitate the active learning, experimental, consistent learning, with student-centred learning. The benefits are as follows: the learning process is more interesting, more interactive, the amount of teaching time can be reduced, the quality of student learning can be improved and the learning process can be done anywhere and anytime. Although interactivity is a widely used term in discussions of multimedia learning, a preliminary look at the literature proves that the definition and the benefits of interactivity are not clear. Some authors have tried to clarify the concept of interactivity and what factors need to be taken into account in the design of interactive systems and to present a unifying model including the user, the learning environment, and a system of connections and concepts that together make up interactivity. Such a model can help inform research, discussion, and design decisions on interactive multimedia instruction. Some tools for designing interactive and multimedia training systems are considered in the paper. Their advantages in teaching students at universities are described. The paper presents the development and description of an interactive multimedia application applied in the course "Coding in Telecommunication Systems". The application, developed in English, allows students at the University of Ruse to learn the basic concepts studied in the course "Coding in Telecommunication Systems", including different codes applied in the field of telecommunications, such as linear block codes, Hamming codes, cyclic codes, BCH codes, Reed-Solomon codes, etc. The application covers different types of testing exercises, for example combining in pairs, crosswords, etc. The application will be used in the educational process in the course "Coding in Telecommunication Systems" for the bachelors in the specialty "Internet and Mobile Communications" in the University of Ruse "Angel Kanchev", and mainly for Erasmus students attending the course. The application is planned to be multilingual, incorporating Bulgarian (designated for Bulgarian students) and Spanish (the second most widely spoken language in the world), in addition to English. © 2020, National Defence University - Carol I Printing House.

Our approach has been to use video resources which are made available to students both ahead of, and during, their laboratory classes to assist with preparation and provide just-in-time self-help during the laboratory. In this study we evaluate the implementation of a user-focused strategy to improve students’ laboratory skills and use a three-stage model, forethought, performance, and self-reflection, to assess the impact and effectiveness of these resources to complement the traditional laboratory teaching resources of laboratory manuals and laboratory teaching staff (demonstrators). Students demonstrated autonomous learning by engaging with the laboratory videos using both active and passive learning approaches. The benefits of our approach are especially evident for students who have English as a second language and students who identify with different learning preferences. Increased student grades and more effective staff-student supervision time requirements are evident across both third-year undergraduate chemistry courses in which these videos were implemented. © 2021 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.},

	abstract = {The educational value of digital game-based language learning has aroused attention in the English language teaching field. Among all language-specific skills, grammar is seldom addressed in game-based language learning, despite the fact that learning grammar is one of the challenging tasks for English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students. Learners often lack the motivation and enthusiasm to learn and pursue goals for using target grammar in authentic contexts relevant to their lives. The contextual gaming approach could therefore be a potential strategy to provide a springboard for practice and personalization. Thus, to inspire learners and to provide a meaningful English learning context, a contextual game-based learning approach was proposed and presented to an EFL grammar course for first-year college students in a northern Taiwanese university. The treatment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and game learning behaviors of the proposed learning approach by situating the experimental group in a contextual game-based learning approach, while the control group learned with a conventional technology-assisted English learning approach. The results revealed that the experimental group's contextual error rate was significantly lower than that of the control group. Analysis of their game learning behaviors further showed differences in the high- and low-achievers’ behavior patterns according to Halliday's functions of language development. Some guiding strategies are suggested for low-achievers in future game-based English grammar instruction and research. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

The data was collected in the form of written feedback from seventy-five adult Pashto (L1) learners of English (L2) having three different educational backgrounds. The data were analyzed by using qualitative thematic analysis software ‘MAXQDA Analytics Pro 2020'. The results brought forth useful insights for learning and teaching the use of English articles for the adult EFL learners. The underlying reasons were found to be the failure in the identification of the concepts of countability, definiteness/indefiniteness of nouns, variability in physical form and concept of nouns, variability across languages, learners/teachers’ attitudes towards articles, lack of article-check in computer software and pedagogical instruction. © 2021 EJAL & the Authors.},

	abstract = {Internationalization is the primary goal of the development of education in Taiwan today. There are foreign students in almost every school in Taiwan. Although they would go to a language school for Chinese classes before coming to Taiwan, each teacher's speaking speed and accent are different, and many technical terms are not taught in a language school. This causes the efficiency of learning to be greatly reduced. However, in order to allow foreign students to understand the content of the class, the switch to teaching in English has caused local students with poor English proficiency to be unable to understand the content of the class. Similarly, in Taiwan, not every subject taken by foreign students is taught in English. The official language, Chinese, is still the main communication tool in Taiwan. In order to improve the learning effectiveness of foreign students and local students in a bilingual environment and to deal with the learning problems caused by insufficient language skills, we have proposed solutions. This solution uses voice recognition and text translation technology, through the teacher's microphone for the real-time simultaneous translation and recording of class content. The method solves the above-mentioned problems. Both foreign and local students can choose the source language and destination language at the same time for their better understanding and learning efficiency.  © 2022 IEEE.},

Many studies have emerged in the field of Information and Communication Technology on visually impaired (VIP) learners using computer-based software programs. With regard to this impact, vocabulary has been given particular emphasis in learning English as a foreign language or second language. Previously, most visually impaired learners were not aware of the learning opportunities to overcome their disability. Recently, learners have been able to study both in special education and inclusive education for partially sighted learners, but the instructional materials and assistive tools have some drawbacks. Textbooks with Braille codes and CDs with a daisy-digital accessible information system have not been easily available to these learners. Furthermore, the contents of standard textbooks did not provide such learners with any assistance. As there have not been any studies on these learners in Thailand, the purpose of this study is to identify the challenges and needs of visually impaired learners of English. This study is a part of a more extensive research program conducted to create assistive technology and tools for young visually impaired Thai learners of English. This paper will focus on multi-sensory material of English vocabulary in special education which will emphasize the development of assistive technology or tools with touch and sound senses in English vocabulary for young VIP learners to encourage sustained learning.

	abstract = {Morphological analysis is a form of problem solving to work out the meanings of unfamiliar words by applying knowledge of morphemes. It has emerged recently as an important predictor of reading comprehension. However, while gamification can potentially be used to teach this skill, few studies have examined its use. To address this, a computer-based gamified approach was developed specifically to improve English morphological analysis. It was integrated into teacher instruction and formed blended learning. In the gamification design, progression/achievement-oriented game design elements (e.g., points, badges, levels and progress bar) were adopted, as were non-digital and social game design elements. A mixed methods approach was used to evaluate the effectiveness of this blended gamified programme on improving students’ learning engagement and reading comprehension when compared to a conventional face-to-face, non-gamified method of teaching. The target was a group of Chinese students learning English as a foreign language (EFL). Two classes, comprising a total of 104 seventh graders, were assigned randomly to either the gamified or the non-gamified programme and received 10 sessions of training (55 min per session). The results of a one-way ANCOVA showed that students in the blended gamified programme performed significantly better on English reading comprehension than the face-to-face, non-gamified group. Furthermore, the blended gamified group showed significantly higher behavioural and cognitive engagement than the non-gamified group, although no significant difference was observed in emotional engagement. Interviews with the students shed light on the factors that improved their learning and engagement in the gamified class. This research expands the current understanding of gamification design and suggests some care should be taken in using social game design elements. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {In the 21st century, the relationship between computer technology and education is becoming more and more rigid, and its influence is getting bigger and bigger. The traditional single teaching mode in English education will cause problems such as low learning interest and unsatisfying individual needs. In order to make up for the shortcomings brought by the traditional teaching model of single professors, blended teaching (BT), that is, a teaching form that combines classroom face-to-face instruction and online learning, has developed rapidly in the field of English education. Therefore, this article will launch a research on the design of a BT system for English education based on computer software. This article designs the structure of the English education BT system, including the presentation layer, the intermediate business layer, and the database layer, and introduces the technical application and operation mode of each layer of the structure. This article designs the functions of the English education BT system in detail from the perspectives of students, teachers, and administrators, and uses genetic algorithms to develop sub-function modules for intelligent English education arranging courses. Finally, the system test shows that when the concurrent number is 50, 80, 100, 200, 300, the CPU usage of the English education mixed system is 17.4%, 20.1 %, 26.4%, 30.7%, 44.6%; memory usage The rates are 16.3%, 20.9%, 22.4%, 27.9%, 37.2%. This shows that the CPU usage and memory usage increase with the increase in concurrency, but the system can run stably and smoothly.  © 2022 IEEE.},

In the corpus statistics, we carried out a detailed data analysis of the translated text and the original text with the help of corpus statistics software to find out the linguistic characteristics of the translated text and the areas that can be improved from the perspective of data statistics. After that, based on frequency, mean value, grading value, and multiplication analysis, we carry out qualitative analysis to study the movie subtitle translation strategy and its causes from multiple perspectives. This thesis aims to make research on film and television translation from a new angle with the help of corpus translation and to make up for the gap in the research direction of film and television translation. Firstly, through the corpus analysis methods such as frequency value, mean value, graded value and multiplier value, a quantitative analysis of film texts is carried out from three levels, namely, high frequency, medium frequency and basic, and it is found that Chinese films have many distinctive characteristics in terms of long words and sentences, words and sentences, beginning and end of sentences, idioms and the use of four-character words. © 2021 CAD Solutions, LLC, http://www.cad-journal.net.},

The platform adopts mainstream collaborative filtering and BPMF (Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization) and big data management methods to provide students' detailed performance analysis reports and push recommendation exercises. The researcher reconciled the flipped teaching model with the AI-based language learning platforming in an experimental class and conventionally in a control class. At the end of the semester, the researcher compared students' performance as well as their attitudes toward the course between the two classes through a postexam paper and a questionnaire. Combining quantitative and qualitative methods, the survey shows that although the AI-based language learning mode failed to significantly increase students' English listening scores, compared with the students in the traditional class, those receiving the new mode held a more positive attitude toward their English listening experience, especially in regard to learning interest, study autonomy, and class involvement. The flipped class mode not only relieved students' partial cognitive processing workloads in class, but also boosted their confidence to engage in classroom discussion by reducing their nervousness through before-class preview. The AI-based language learning platform mainly performs monitoring and tutoring functions which facilitate the flipped class instruction. This study proposes a new flipped teaching model and proves it effective, indicating that for the flipped class learning mode to be successful, it is of importance to integrate face-to-face classroom instruction with the AI-technology-assisted online learning experience in a way that they can coherently support each other.  © 2022 Bing Li and Miaomiao Peng.},

This study extends this research line by investigating the pedagogical strategies which Vietnamese L2 English secondary school teachers employed in online teaching and challenges they encountered from applying these strategies. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with eighteen randomly selected EFL teachers from ten secondary schools in Tra Vinh Province, Vietnam. The study adopted a content-based approach to data analysis. Results showed that the teachers used a diversity of pedagogical strategies regarding classroom management, instruction delivery, students’ engagement, and interaction. During the teaching process, they dealt with four main types of challenges: technological, pedagogical, organizational, and psychological.

The method mainly relies on students' lexical coverage to determine the readability level of textbooks, taking into consideration that readability depends primarily on vocabulary knowledge and that it is a function of lexical coverage in teaching English as a Foreign Language (EFL). The appropriateness of the reading material used is critical. If it is inappropriate, the chances that learners understand it are substantially jeopardized. This study examined seven EFL textbooks currently in use in Algerian public schools to determine whether learners' lexical coverage is at the textbook readability level (Independent Reading Level), above it (Instructional Reading Level), or below it (Frustrational Reading Level). It adopted a multi-instrument computer-based approach. Results showed that all the textbooks have low lexical coverage and readability, which puts them at the frustrational level. Moreover, it was found that 4 out of 7 textbooks demonstrated a discrepancy in terms of lexical coverage as the rate of common vocabulary across all textbooks was very low. Comparing the lexical coverage of the seven textbooks to standard vocabulary lists revealed that students are not learning sufficient, useful, and appropriate vocabulary. © 2021, TESOL International Journal.

This study set out to explore how Edmodo was utilized to mediate digital class in English language teaching (ELT); how Edmodo facilitated students’ engagement during the class; and how Edmodo mediated teachers to assess students’ learning outcomes. A qualitative approach was employed and 286 students from a secondary school voluntarily participated in this study. Interviews, online mini-polling, and document analysis were deployed as data collection methods, and data were validated by triangulation and analyzed by following the interactive model data analysis. It revealed that Edmodo was an effective mode to mediate digital class in ELT as the students could interact with their teachers, peers, and course contents effectively, both inside and outside the classroom. The students’ engagement was also better in comparison to that of the face-to-face classroom. Finally, Edmodo well-mediated teachers to carry out the computer-based test (CBT); it was an accurate mode of assessment as no cheatings were facilitated; the validity, and reliability of the test could be favorably accomplished. © 2020, Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta (Yogyakarta State University).

This study, therefore, sought to identify KSA postsecondary EFL instructors’ self-reporting of their use of various types of technology, computer software, and online software; the different teaching/learning and assessment strategies that they employ; the obstacles they face with the use of technology in their classrooms; and their beliefs about the use of multimodal digital literacy practices for teaching and learning. The study, which was based on the premises of social semiotic theory, utilized a mixed-methods design from which survey and focus group interview data were triangulated. The findings demonstrated that while most postsecondary EFL instructors have a strong positive attitude towards multimodal digital literacy practices and make robust use of specific types of technology and software programs, obstacles prevent these practices from being more widely and frequently deployed in the KSA. Suggestions for how to make a transformation to a more pronounced use of multimodal practices happen and the limitations to the study are also presented. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.},

Consequently, the traditional way of learning and assessment of English language in Saudi Arabia has now given way to newer and more innovative ways. The present study aimed at identifying the latest trends in learning and assessment of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) and their effectiveness in students' attitudes and learning in Saudi Arabia's undergraduate programs. The study collected and analysed both quantitative and qualitative data. An interview was conducted with 18 faculty members to collect qualitative data, and responses received from it were analysed thematically. The interview brought out some budding trends and developments in the domain of learning and assessment at undergraduate English majors of Saudi Arabia. It revealed that technology-assisted learning, blended learning, role play, task-based learning, inquiry-based learning, neuro-linguistic programming, project-based approach, lexical approach and eclectic method were the common trends and developments that teachers adopted those days. On the other hand, quantitative data was collected from a survey of 250 students on their perceptions towards the latest trends and developments in learning and assessment of EFL in their courses. The study used the SPSS software, in which correlation and regression analysis were applied to test the hypothesis. The survey pointed out that new methods of learning and assessment of English language do have a significant impact on student effectiveness. However, students faced certain challenges as well like distraction, lack of interaction, difficulty to retain concepts etc. © 2020 Asian E F L Journal Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Computer-assisted language assessment literacy (LAL) has gained momentum in English as a foreign language (EFL) teaching since computer-based education became particularly common in language education. As EFL teachers play a critical role in administering computer-assisted language assessments, Iranian EFL teachers need to learn, relearn, and improve their computer-assisted LAL. Iranian EFL teachers can use collaborative reflection (CR) to improve their computer-assisted LAL and practices. This study, therefore, qualitatively investigated how collaborative reflective practices can improve novice and experienced EFL teachers’ computer-assisted LAL. To achieve the goals of the present study, we adopted an instrumental case study to explore how EFL teachers perceive the benefits, applications, and challenges of computer-assisted language assessment practices and how teachers could improve their computer-assisted LAL through virtual CR. Four novice and experienced EFL teachers were selected purposively to explore internet-based CR through social media, observations, and interviews. The data were qualitatively analyzed through inductive thematic analysis. The results of the study demonstrated that computer-assisted language assessment practices enhanced the quality of formative assessment and assessment for learning, authenticity, and meaningfulness of tasks, administration, scoring, and interpretation, among others. Furthermore, EFL teachers experienced various personal, social, educational, and professional advantages of their computer-based language assessment practices through internet-based CR. The pedagogical implications of the study for the development of computer-assisted LAL of EFL in-service language teachers through online reflective practices are discussed. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the relationship between a metaphor-based approach to teaching English as a foreign language (EFL) and involvement of the brain’s right hemisphere. Specifically, it examined learners’ understanding of three levels of sureness associated with different expressions in English – those that are certain, probable, and possible items. The three target items were chosen because they are frequently used by native English speakers although Japanese EFL learners often fail to distinguish between them. The metaphor-based learners and the control group engaged in computer-based explicit learning based on the meaning of the target expressions with three-dimensional (3D) animated illustrations. The images were based on the spatial concept of distance for the metaphor-based learners and a list of target items for the control group. At post-test, it was found that the metaphor-based learners performed better than the control group in both comparison and speaking tests. Obviously, the participants better understood the degrees of certainty in relation to distance. This shows that teaching the degrees of certainty by applying the spatial concept of distance could help in second-language (L2) learning. The metaphor approach allowed participants to link the spatial concept of distance to the degree of certainty associated with expressions of certitude. In addition, recordings of lip movements showed that participants remembered the target items better by opening the left side of their mouths more than the right side. This indicates that the brain’s right hemisphere is involved in deep processing of expressions that reflect different levels of certitude and creating stronger memory traces. © 2023, The International Academic Forum (IAFOR).

	abstract = {Background: Previous research has examined the use of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) in English language teaching. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the earlier studies that investigated integrating AR and VR “wearables” into teaching and learning English based on the attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction (ARCS) motivation model compared the differences in learning motivation and performance between traditional teaching methods and those using AR- and VR-based using wearables. Objectives: To create a thematic learning environment based on learners' lived experiences and provide them with an immersive English course that extends textbook knowledge using a technology-assisted real-life learning context. Method: This study used a quasi-experimental research design. A total of 119 participants were spilt into three learning groups based on teaching tools: traditional methods and AR- and VR-based wearable devices. The performance of each group was evaluated through three stages using appropriate educational tools for traditional, AR-, and VR-based classrooms, followed by semistructured interviews. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to investigate the inference learning performance (remembering and analysing) of the four ARCS dimensions with the three teaching methods. Results: The results showed that confidence and relevance were positively correlated with learning performance in the VR-based wearable group. In the context of the ARCS model, learners' confidence predicted learning performance and the remembering subdimension when VR-based learning materials were used. Implications: These results suggest that, compared to traditional teaching methods, VR-based wearables make it easier to create a highly immersive learning environment and are more likely to help learners find the correct words, improve their accuracy, and increase their confidence and sense of accomplishment in the entire learning process. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Aim/Purpose This study investigated the integration of Google Docs in facilitating under graduate students' interactional collaboration in an online translation course. The study also explored the engagement patterns that emerge when students use Google Docs and evaluated their experience of using this platform in collaborative translation. Background Integration of technology in specialized English translation classes has become crucial to empower students with the required skills in the labor market. However, students might perceive specialized translation as a tedious and difficult process and become reluctant to engage in translation classes. Few studies have investigated students' performance and engagement aspects in online collaborative translation contexts. Methodology This study employed a mixed-method approach. Multiple sources of data were collected from translation tests, an engagement questionnaire, semi-structured interviews, and students' interactions on the online platforms. Ninety-three students majoring in business administration were purposefully assigned into a control group and two experimental groups. Throughout six weeks, students in the first experimental group collaborated on translation assignments via discussion forum boards on a Learning Management System (LMS), whereas students in the second experimental group used Google Docs to complete three translation assignments. Control group students completed the same assignments individually. Contribution This study contributes to the previous body of knowledge in the field of collaborative learning, translation, and educational technology by exploring the effectiveness of using Google Docs in improving students' collaboration and engagement in a specialized translation course. Findings One-way ANOVA for the translation post-tests showed a statistically signifi cant improvement in the overall translation performance and translation sub- skills of the experimental group who used Google Docs compared to the control group and the experimental group who interacted through discussion forums. Descriptive statistics of the engagement questionnaire revealed a significant statistical increase in the Google Docs group's behavioral, cognitive, and affective engagement. Content analysis of the qualitative data showed that students engaged behaviorally by giving and receiving feedback both at the global and local levels and cognitively through questioning, giving constructive comments, and justifying arguments. Students also engaged effectively and expressed positive feelings when collaborating online. Moreover, students reported the usefulness of using Google Docs in the collaborative translation process and expressed their satisfaction and confidence. Recommendations Practitioners should use collaborative technological tools to upgrade transla-for Practitioners tors' skills and increase students' engagement. Recommendations It is recommended that researchers compare students' engagement in different for Researchers learning modalities and explore the relationship between students' translation competence and their engagement level. Impact on Society The society of specialized translation will be improved by implementing inno vative pedagogical techniques in teaching and training translators. This research can raise awareness of the importance of online tools in exchanging learning experiences inside and outside the academic contexts. Future Research Future studies should explore the impact of implementing web/computer- based tools in the collaborative translation of different genres and various languages. © 2021.

An electronic course “English Word Order” using CorrectWriting software for Moodle LMS was developed and used to teach students of various levels of education. The system of formative and summative assessments regarding the word order of English sentences was studied. The students’ responses to CorrectWriting questions were analyzed using the Longest Common Subsequence algorithm, allowing determining misplaced, missing and extraneous words. During formative assessments, the students were offered automatic hints on how to fix their mistakes without having to wait for feedback from the teacher. The learning gains and the student survey prove the efficiency of the developed online course which helps to improve students’ grammar skills during the classes and unsupervised work. The study also notes a positive role of electronic teaching materials in optimizing the technological and organizational support of the educational process.

	abstract = {Advances in writing technologies have fostered the gradual move from Paper-Based (PB) to Computer-Based (CB) writing assessment in foreign language (FL) education. The trend was further boosted by the outburst of the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to drastic changes in teaching and assessment practices. In higher education (HE) contexts, writing assessment in English as a foreign language (EFL) is more and more often managed by means of online learning platforms, where students create and submit written assignments on the computer. This paper examines a sample of 100 EFL exam essays completed by 100 Italian university students. Half of the essays were computer-typed on Moodle from home during the Covid-19 lockdown, whereas the other half were handwritten on paper during a face-to-face exam session after the Covid-19 emergency. The study presented herein compares the amount and types of formal errors in the CB and PB written assignments respectively. The results of the comparison may be useful to suggest hypotheses on the impact that both writing modality and environment can have on the quality of EFL writing in assessment contexts.

	abstract = {This study was conducted to examine the effects of training in Information Communication Technology-assisted (ICT-assisted) English language teaching on secondary school English language teachers’ pedagogical knowledge and English language proficiency. To achieve this goal, a one-group within-subject quasi-experimental design was utilized. Twenty-two (n = 22) teachers selected from three government secondary schools in Arba Minch and Sawla towns of Gamo and Gofa zones of South Nations, Nationalities, and the Peoples Regional State of Ethiopia were included in the study using a comprehensive sampling technique. Four rounds of repeated measurements were used to collect data and Friedman’s test was used to compare the mean scores to examine the effects of the training on the teachers’ pedagogical knowledge and English language proficiency. Related-samples Kendall’s coefficient of concordance (effect size) was also run using the same non-parametric test of Friedman’s test to exmine the magnitude of the effect. The results revealed that training in ICT-assisted teaching has a significant effect on the pedagogical knowledge and English language proficiency of the teachers. Moreover, the independent variable (training in ICT-assisted English language teaching) has a strong effect (effect size) on their pedagogical knowledge and English language proficiency. Based on the results, in-service teacher training in ICT-assisted teaching is recommended to harness the potential of new technologies for English language teachers’ professional development. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Purpose: Web-based language learning (WBLL) materials have long been favored by English language instructors because they are plentiful, easily accessible, user-friendly and, most importantly, free. This research looks into the effects of learning the simple perfect tense translation in three different English translation classes that used three different teaching methods: traditional face-to-face, integrative and web-based learning. It also aims to investigate the impact of gender on every mode of instruction and to identify the most effective method for learning translation. Design/methodology/approach: The study is quantitative, with a pretest/posttest quasi-experimental research design. A total of 93 third-year undergraduate students (51 female and 42 male students) participated in the pretest/posttest design. Each group was exposed to one mode of instruction for nine weeks. All groups sat for a pretest in the first week of the treatment. After the treatment, the participants were provided with a posttest, and the data obtained were analyzed using the SPSS computer software program. Findings: The findings revealed a significant difference in both tests for all modes used. All three groups improved in their gain score, but the highest gain among these groups was the integrative method, followed by web-based learning. The result of the independent sample t-tests and ANOVA exhibited that there was no significant difference in the level of students between the two groups, both were sig. two-tailed (p = 0.342). Furthermore, it was discovered that gender did not affect students' performance in the posttest (Z = −1.564, p > 0.05) when each mode of instruction was applied. Finally, the integrative method was observed to be the most effective. Practical implications: The findings can inspire translation course designers to plan necessary policies or syllabi regarding English translation courses and may serve as a platform for improving the curriculum for training and motivating the next generation of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners. Originality/value: The findings of this study could be used to improve English instruction in countries where English is a second or foreign language. The actual gap in knowledge is that no other studies have compared all three groups in the past few years. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {With the advances of technology and the Internet, computer-based assessment (e-assessment) has been in high demand in higher educational institutions (HEIs), especially during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown, due to the convenience, ease of use, and accuracy. Consequently, this study aims to explore how MOODLE, an open-source learning management system (LMS), is utilized as a means of e-assessment in English reading and listening courses to assist undergraduates of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) and educational teams in HEIs to maintain high levels of students’ retention and to reduce the percentage of poor learning performance. The participants were 120 undergraduates and four teachers of six listenings and six reading courses in a public university in Vietnam. The research data was the results of the pre-test, mid-term, and final test on both English listening skills and reading skills recorded in the MOODLE system during the second semester of the academic year 2019-2020. The average scores of pre-test, mid-term, and final tests on each skill were taken and used as the benchmark for measuring listening and reading performance. In addition, a self-report survey was conducted after an experiment to investigate the participants’ attitude towards MOODLE-based e-assessment. The experimental results showed that students’ listening and reading performance in the final tests was higher than that in the pre-tests and the participants also had positive attitudes towards e-assessment. Particularly, the average scores of listening skills were 3.82/10.00 (pre-test), 4.51/10.00 (mid-term test), and 6.00/10.00 (final test) while those of reading skills were 4.55/10.00 (pre-test), 4.85/10.00 (mid-term test), and 5.43/10.00 (final test). The analysis results are expected to be a roadmap for e-assessment in teaching English listening and reading skills during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown to maintain high levels of students’ retention and to reduce the percentage of poor learning performance. © 2021, Southeast Asian Association for Institutional Research.

However, the trend of using digital technology integrated CLIL in English language education still lacks systematic analysis. The present study aims to examine the published research articles in academic journals, indexed by the Scopus database from 2010 to 2019 was conducted to investigate in terms of nationalities, authors, journals, research methods, research issues, technology learning materials, and educational stages. The finding revealed that the use of CLIL integrated digital technology in English language learning has been positively successful in developing students' learning motivation and competence, not only technological skills but also content subjects and English language competencies. The results show that video technology was the most popular tool for enhancing students' motivation and promoting students' learning ability in English language within the context of CLIL methodology. Therefore, the highest interesting research method was system development that concern of digital technology development which contributes to better effective learning tools. Based on the overall finding, it is clear that CLIL integrated digital technology is an effective tool in English foreign language learning. Although the studies quite still rather low in the last recent year and also mainly in European countries that focusing on higher educational participants, it could bring some challenges of the limited practice to explore the use of CLIL blended technology in learning English in school within Asian countries that are increasingly bilingual setting.

The students in these contexts who are not English native speakers express concerns associated with learning both content knowledge and English. In the digital age, one question is whether and how they are adapting to the emerging context of EMI. This paper addresses the query by reporting results from a qualitative study on the self-regulated learning strategies of 24 students in EMI economics courses at one Vietnamese university. The data collected from classroom observations and focus group discussions were thematically analysed. Results revealed that the students deployed technology-assisted self-regulated strategies in their learning activities both inside and outside class, which are in line with three phases of forethought, performance, and self-reflection in the selfregulation model. This reflects special characteristics of students in a digital age and raises implications for the learning support and EMI teaching practices integrated with digital technologies. © 2023, IGI Global.

	abstract = {In this era of technology, teachers need to adapt to changes in their profession, and learn faster than before. They don’t want to be restricted to their isolated classrooms and schools but continue learning anywhere, anytime. When a teacher attends conferences, joins teaching communities and discusses new techniques and innovations with colleagues, that means s/he is building a personal learning network (PLN). Face-to-face PLN has been extended to technology-assisted networks lately, as technology has led to new ways of learning and socializing. Teaching is not a solitary act, and teachers need other teachers to be complete. In this respect, social media such as Twitter, Facebook, blogs, are suitable virtual platforms for personal learning. In the literature, very limited research has been conducted regarding PLNs as a whole concept rather than individual digital platforms among English language teachers in Turkey directly. Responding to gap in the literature, this study was conducted through a questionnaire with 302 participants. For open questions, a thematic analysis was done while for closed questions, frequencies and percentages were taken. The findings show that English language teachers in Turkey utilize technology-assisted PLNs as a sharing and learning platform and expand the boundaries of their immediate contacts. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Scaffolding is a mechanism for helping novice learners to solve a problem or complete a task that is beyond their current skill set. Prior research on immersive virtual reality (IVR) environments with scaffolding has mainly focused on the effectiveness of scaffolding for conceptual understanding and information processing. However, research on defining guidelines for designing computer-based scaffolds for IVR is scarce. To fill this gap, some recommendations are provided in this paper on how to design scaffolds for IVR environments for teaching English as a Foreign Language (EFL). An eye-tracking study was conducted with N = 41 university students from three EFL courses that used two versions of an IVR application for learning and practicing prepositions of place in English with different scaffolding mechanisms and in different contexts: a context in which the participant can move through the virtual space and a context in which the participant remains seated. A comparative analysis was conducted to determine which scaffolds were more appropriate for learning in IVR. This study extends previous research on scaffolding in IVR environments by suggesting some empirical evidence, collected from eye-tracking, of the effectiveness of different types of scaffolds in IVR environments and some design guidelines are provided. The results showed that scaffolds that are naturally embedded in the IVR environment and are closer to the objects that students need to interact with, are more effective for increasing their learning performance. Practical implications of this study for instructional designers and developers include: scaffolds should be designed considering the spatial contiguity principle and should be naturally blended with the VR environment. Scaffolds should direct students attention to the most important information and scaffolds can be provided in different forms (text, images and on-site indicators). © 2021, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.},

The paper's main objective is to explore the extent to which modern technologies contribute to the process of teaching and learning English at Saudi universities. This is conducted by probing the benefits and challenges of using Blackboard Collaborate as a digital platform through which the different university courses are taught. The study, therefore, seeks to highlight the role of a computer-based instruction, by shedding light on the opportunities and challenges of incorporating latest technologies into the pedagogy of learning and teaching English as a foreign language in the Saudi universities. Two methodological instruments are used to collect data: The first is electronic questionnaires to test both students' and teachers' attitudinal perception towards the use of Blackboard in the learning/teaching process; and the second is an interview conducted with 29 staff members affiliated to 5 different Saudi universities concerning the use of Blackboard as a digital platform of teaching various university courses. Results reveal that despite the challenges that encounter both students and teachers in managing the process of learning and teaching via Blackboard Collaborate amid COVID-19, which are ascribed to some technical and academic reasons, this digital platform proves useful and conductive to better learning outcomes as it offers a bendable learning environment through which participants can flexibly manage their learning, both synchronously and asynchronously, by attending their classes, accessing their courses materials, participating in discussions, and sitting for examinations.  © 2021 JLLS and the Authors-Published by JLLS.},

They have been applied to various fields because of their wearability, mobility, user-centered, interactive, integrated and augmented reality characteristics. Given the shortcomings of traditional foreign language education at university, wearable technology is introduced into foreign language classroom as an auxiliary form of traditional teaching. This article chooses two courses (171 and 172 courses) to test whether wearable devices have an impact on college English teaching. The English level of these two classes is similar. With the assistance of wearable technology, level 171 is selected as the experimental course; 172 is a regular course, using only traditional teaching methods, and the experiment lasted for a semester. Practical teaching is also carried out in the class. Practical teaching results show that wearable technology assisted English teaching can not only improve students’ ability to master knowledge, but also greatly enhance students' interest in learning English. © The Author(s) 2021.},

Many English translation tools emerge as the times require. With the rapid development of computer software technology, the development and application of English translation software has attracted more and more attention. Machine translation is an important research field of natural language processing, which has a wide application prospect in today's information society and military departments. Traditional machine translation methods use pipeline successive operations to identify parts of speech and parse the original corpus, so as to obtain the syntactic structure of English language, which makes the error iterative transmission between translation tasks and the accuracy of structured examples lower, which leads to the lower accuracy of English language and literature translation. Based on rough set theory, this paper expounds the application of translation accuracy correction algorithm in English translation software.  © 2021 ACM.},

To this end, 40 intermediate-level EFL learners in a language institute were selected through a placement test and were assigned to experimental and control groups. The control group (non-flipped classroom) was exposed to in-class activities and instructional materials in the print format whereas the experimental group (micro flipped classroom) was exposed to both in-class and out-of-class instructional materials, including mini videos uploaded before class via Edmodo, a technology-based pedagogical environment. To assess the participants’ speaking fluency, they were interviewed at the beginning and end of their course, and the recorded speech data were analyzed through PRAAT (computer software package for speech analysis) in terms of six aspects of speaking fluency, including articulation rate (syllables per second), rate of all pauses, rate of long pauses, rate of unfilled and filled pauses and mean length of run. The analysis of the data through Mann-Whitney tests revealed statistically significant differences regarding the measures of fluency with the higher articulate rate and mean length of run and lower rates of pauses for the experimental group in the posttest interview. The findings accentuate the role of the flipped classroom and blended learning where second/foreign language (L2) leaners can develop their L2 speaking skills and fluency in online and actual settings. © 2021 AsiaTEFL All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Computer-assisted instruction has been widely implemented in language learning since the remarkable development of speech technology and natural language processing. In English teaching, the traditional manual evaluation mode has been replaced by the computer. In this paper, we introduce a machine scoring method of Role-Play Section in the English oral test. Specifically, we design a scoring method of Role-Play section in Computer-based English Listening and Speaking Test (CELST) of the Guangdong college entrance examination (GDCEE), which can simulate human scoring. The role-play section is also called Three Questions (TQ) and Five Answers (FA), so two scoring modules are established, respectively. According to the features of the role-play section and the given manual scoring scale, the scoring task can be regarded as a short text similarity evaluation task, and we propose a corresponding multi-index text similarity evaluation method. Statistic-based word matching and keyword-focused semantic similarity evaluations are adopted in the TQ and FA scoring modules. Additionally, we consider the grammar factor and utilize semantic similarity-combined dependency parsing evaluation for TQ scoring. Based on the above five evaluative indicators, we linearly integrate them and corresponding expertise-based weights with linear regression optimization, thus constructing a comprehensive scoring model of the role-play Section in CELST. Experiments were conducted using real oral data of examinees in GDCEE. Results have indicated that the machine scoring method achieves impressive data consistency with human scoring.  © 2021 ACM.},

	abstract = {Thanks to the rapid development of technology, there has been an increasing number of studies integrating technologies into language teaching and learning over the past few decades. Under the auspices of technology, interpreting education has also experienced a transformation from traditional teacher-led classrooms into learner-centered and interactive paradigms. While the use of technology has been extensively investigated and reviewed in English language teaching contexts, especially English as a second/foreign language, computer-assisted interpreter training (CAIT) has been under-researched and reviewed. This paper aims to provide a bird’s-eye view of ways in which interpreting learning has been reconciled with different types of technological tools. This paper systematically reviews 36 articles on CAIT from 2013 to 2023 and surveys the major patterns and development trends. It traces how technology over time has been incorporated into interpreter training and summarizes the state-of-the-art application of technology in CAIT. The findings suggest that there has been a steady increase in pedagogical research on CAIT, in particular empirical studies on learning outcomes and students’ perceptions of higher education in European countries. Various technological tools have been examined, and the results generally indicate that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. The paper concludes with some insights into future studies. Based on theoretical frameworks, more experiential research is needed to examine the effects of multiple emerging technologies in various language contexts. More studies are needed to explore the contextual, individual, and influencing factors from both teacher and student perspectives. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {One of the latest teaching strategies is smart classroom teaching. Teaching is carried out with the assistance of smart teaching technologies to improve teacher-student contact, increase students’ learning autonomy, and give fresh ideas for the fulfillment of students’ deep learning. Computer-based technology has improved students’ language learning and significantly motivating them to continue learning while also stimulating their creativity and enthusiasm. However, the difficulties and barriers that many EFL instructors are faced on seeking to integrate information and communication technology (ICT) into their instruction have raised discussions and concerns regarding ICT’s real worth in the language classroom. This is a case study that includes observations in the classroom, field notes, interviews, and written materials. In EFL classrooms, both computer-based and non-computer-based activities were recorded and analyzed. The main instrument in this study was a survey questionnaire comprising 43 items, which was used to examine the efficiency of ICT integration in teaching and learning in public schools in Kuala Lumpur. A total of 101 questionnaires were delivered, while each responder being requested to read the statements provided. The total number of respondents for this study was 101 teachers from Kuala Lumpur’s public secondary schools. The questionnaire was randomly distributed to respondents with a teaching background. This study indicated the accuracy of utilizing Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) in analyzing the survey results and potential for students to learn English as a foreign language using computers. Also, the usage of foreign language may be improved if real computer-based activities are introduced into the lesson. Copyright © 2022 Techno-Press, Ltd.},

In order to overcome the defects of isolated learning and noise sensitivity of SOM, this paper proposes a new time self-organization model (TSOM) from the perspective of deep learning. On the basis of self-organizing mapping network, time enhancement mechanism is introduced to improve the system performance. This method makes up for the fixed spatial topology of the original self-organizing mapping network and the neglect of the time factor, which is crucial to the voice signal. At the same time, this paper makes full use of computer-aided technology and rich network resources to provide a comprehensive and systematic English pronunciation learning database and establish learners’ pronunciation files. Once learners understand and master the operation of voice analysis software, they can conduct self-assessment and judgment to find out their blind spots and weaknesses in voice acquisition. © 2023 IGI Global.

	abstract = {This study examined the validity of data collected from a novel online story retell task. The task was specifically designed for use by junior school teachers with the support of speech–language therapists or literacy specialists. The assessment task was developed to monitor children's oral language progress in their first year at school as part of the Better Start Literacy Approach for early literacy teaching. Teachers administered the task to 303 5-year-olds in New Zealand at school entry and after 20 weeks and 12 months of schooling. The children listened to a story with pictures via iPad presentation and were then prompted to retell the story. The children's spontaneous language used in their story retell was captured and uploaded digitally via iPad audio recording and analyzed using semi-automated speech recognition and computer software. Their responses to factual and inferential story comprehension questions were also analyzed. The data suggested that the task has good criterion validity. Significant correlations between story retell measures and a standardized measure of children's oral language were found. The Better Start Literacy Approach story retell task, which took approximately 6 min for teachers to administer, accurately identified children with low oral language ability 81% of the time. Growth curve analysis revealed that the task was useful for monitoring oral language development, including for English as second language learners. Boys showed a slower story comprehension growth trajectory than girls. The Better Start Literacy Approach story retell task shows promise in providing valid data to support teacher judgement of children's oral language development. © The Author(s) 2023.},

First, the basic principles and network structure of the long short-term memory network LSTM are specifically analyzed; then, a multilayer rule model is constructed; after that, an attention model-based LSTM verb grammar checker is designed, and a word embedding model is used to encode the text and map it to the status space to retain the textual information. Finally, the proposed algorithm is experimentally validated using the corpus dataset. The experimental results revealed that the accuracy, recall, and F1 values of the proposed algorithm in verb error detection were 45.51%, 28.77%, and 35.5%, respectively, which were higher than those of the traditional automatic review algorithm, indicating that the proposed algorithm has superior performance and can improve the accuracy and efficiency of grammar error detection.  © 2022 Feng Wu et al.},

In consistency with prior findings, the study results produced a significant decrease in anxiety in general, corroborating the interview and the self-recalling measure results. Further, the self-recalled scale revealed a more complex pattern of anxiety with the general decreasing tendency mixed with the increasing trend between the last two weeks.

For college students' English teaching, the most appropriate and effective way is to widely apply multimedia courses to English teaching. Using the rich multimedia knowledge of multimedia courses to expand students' oral English and teaching skills, widen the reading path of reading and writing, multimedia tutoring teaching can concretize and visualize abstract knowledge well, and rich multimedia knowledge can facilitate students' learning and play an important role in understanding knowledge. This paper focuses on multimedia technology-assisted college English grammar teaching. The multimedia technology is analyzed by using the multimedia data hashing algorithm with semantic fusion. Then, the application of multimedia teaching materials in teaching and traditional teaching methods is experimented. By comparing their learning effects, the author draws a conclusion that multimedia technology has been applied in English grammar teaching to a certain extent, and the present situation of its application is relatively good. Most of them have an encouraging attitude, especially in improving students' learning attitude and increasing their interest in learning. Due to the limitations of awareness and conditions, the extent and progress of the integration of information technology and disciplines have lagged behind relatively, and there are many difficulties in the application of multimedia course materials; there are certain difficulties in integrating multimedia course materials and English subjects.  © 2022 Huarui Xu and Yun Yao.},

Although it has been historically underemphasized, recent empirical studies have pointed to its potential value in listening education. However, instructors and students generally face certain challenges when developing decoding skills. In this study, we used a meta-synthesis approach to examine all available empirical studies and identify five main challenges in decoding training: (a) insufficient time and practice, (b) student disengagement, (c) cognitive overload, (d) undifferentiated learning, and (e) ineffective feedback. We also discuss how technology was used in these studies to address these challenges. Finally, we identify several gaps in technology-assisted decoding training and offer recommendations for future research. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {In a randomized-controlled trial we tested a computer-assisted intervention for the prevention of reading difficulties, delivered by nonprofessional tutors, running from kindergarten to halfway Grade 2. The full sample included 123 prereaders (M = 5; 6 years; 56 intervention; 67 controls) with low preliteracy skills. Parents were sent a questionnaire to assess family risk (FR) for reading difficulties. There was no intervention effect in the full sample, but, unexpectedly, the effect differed between subsamples that did and did not return the questionnaire. The intervention did not affect reading acquisition in the subsample (N = 49) without FR-data, mostly children from immigrant, non-Dutch speaking, low-socioeconomic status (SES) families, but had large effects in the subsample of Dutch-speaking, middle and high SES-parents with FR-data (N = 74). The latter subsample was followed until Grade 6, 4 years after the intervention, and included 36 intervention children and 38 controls. Long-lasting improvements were found in word-reading fluency, which transferred to reading fluency for pseudowords, English words: and texts, and to spelling. The intervention substantially reduced the need for remedial teaching and grade retention. On all measures, children with FR performed worse than children without FR. The intervention had similar effects on the progress of both groups, but the FR children needed more sessions. This study shows that a 2-year cost-effective early intervention can reduce the incidence of reading difficulties. However, it remains a challenge to make the intervention suited for children in which a lack of preliteracy skills merely seems to reflect a lack of learning opportunities. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Educational Impact and Implications Statement—Is it possible to prevent reading difficulties? Children with poor preliteracy skills in Kindergarten received a computer-based intervention delivered by parents and volunteers, ∼3x/week, 10–15 min/session, for 2 years (kindergarten to second Grade). Children from immigrant, non-Dutch speaking, low-SES families did not benefit from the intervention. In the other children, the intervention lastingly improved reading and spelling up till sixth grade, and reduced grade retention. These findings indicate that providing early intensive supplementary reading intervention is a cost-effective way to prevent reading difficulties. However, the intervention needs to be improved to make it successful for children in which a lack of preliteracy skills reflects a lack of learning opportunities.

	abstract = {With the continuous development of interactive multimedia, multimedia is increasingly integrated into college English teaching, providing advanced teaching equipment and resources. While enriching the teaching environment, it also brings new challenges to teaching ideas and strategies. Although the proportion of independent and selective learning of college students has increased, classroom teaching still constitutes the most essential unit of educational activities. Classroom evaluation is an important means and institutionalized element to improve the quality of university teaching. This paper analyzes the elements of multimedia classroom teaching and constructs an evaluation index system for English multimedia teaching. The improved model is used to achieve automatic teaching grading, acquire knowledge through environmental learning and improve its own performance, and evaluate the mathematical model of the English multimedia teaching evaluation system established by neural network theory accurately and effectively. In this paper, the results of automatic scoring of multimedia English teaching in colleges and universities are compared. Simulation software is used to verify the established neural network evaluation system. The simulation results show that the model is more suitable for the test data of English classroom teaching than the traditional methods, and the prediction effect is better.

	abstract = {This paper investigates the validation of the computer-based listening subtest in the Certificate of English for Primary Teachers (CEPT), which is addressed to in-service primary teachers who work in state Italian schools. Since 2004, these teachers, specialists in other subjects, have been asked by the Italian Ministry of Education to teach English to their pupils. Training courses for different CEFR levels and certification have been devised by Italian universities for in-service teachers who are then allowed to teach English in primary schools. This study will briefly illustrate the new requirements set by the European Council in terms of foreign language teaching and learning from an early age. A profile of the foreign language teacher will then be presented and a more detailed analysis of the Italian situation will be provided. The paper then presents the CEPT administered in the Emilia-Romagna region, Italy, by the Language Centre of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, with a special focus on the listening subtest. In order to validate the listening test tasks, a mixed methods study was conducted. In particular, the results of the listening subtest administered in June 2015 to 67 candidates and in June 2017 to a new sample of 354 test takers have been statistically analysed and semi-structured interviews have been conducted with a test developer, a teacher trainer and a test taker. In order to shed light on the content relevance and coverage of the CEPT listening subtest under investigation, the judgement expressed by three experienced University English language instructors has been analysed. The results of the quantitative and qualitative data gathered confirm the validity of the CEPT listening subtest. Implications for future research are provided. © 2020 De Gruyter Mouton.

However, these studies are few compared with those emphasizing on other skills such as reading and writing. This case study thus aims to fill this gap by adopting the Windows Speech Recognition (WSR) system to help English learners improve pronunciation skills and promote learner autonomy. Drawing on the Interaction Hypothesis in Second Language Acquisition, this study sought to answer two questions: (1) with the use of WSR in pronunciation training, what is learner performance of pronouncing /n/ and /l/ sounds? and (2) what are learner attitudes toward this training? The training lasted for three weeks, with one hour each time and twice a week. Data sets included a pre-test (screening test) and a post-test based on screen- and audio-recordings of training sessions, a questionnaire, and a semi-structured interview with students. Field notes were also recorded when the entire training process was observed. Findings revealed that learner performance shown in the screening- and posttest is not significant. However, it indicates that with appropriate training, it is possible for learners to understand the feedback provided by WSR and apply the knowledge to judge their own practices. In addition, since learners held positive attitudes towards the use of this software, it is suggested that teachers or tutors can integrate the software with their curriculum for improving English students' pronunciation skills of segmental features, their learner autonomy and learning strategy.},

Document summarization is an established text mining technique which focuses on extracting succinct summaries of potentially long textual documents. The application of summarization algorithms in the e-learning context is particularly appealing, because readers may want to pinpoint the key concepts by reading short summaries instead of the whole document content. This paper investigates the application of a state-of-the-art summarization algorithm to English-written academic teaching material. The summarizer produces an ordered sequence of key phrases extracted from learning material organized in different sections. The generated summaries are provided to students as additional material for study and revision. A crowd-sourcing experience of evaluation of the generated summaries was conducted by involving the students of a B.S. Course given by a technical university. The results show that the automatically generated summaries reflect, to a large extent, the student's expectations and therefore they can be useful for supporting individual and collective learning activities. © 2015 IEEE.},

The data were gathered using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The quantitative data was collected using by GBM and GAM (McCroskey & Richmond, 1989) which are the most standardized and highly reliable data gathering tools to measure beliefs and attitudes of respondents in wide range topics. Three open ended questions were also used as data collecting instrument to reveal the practice of using TALT in the EFL classroom. Finally the descriptive analysis of the GBM result showed that both EFL students (m=5.87; SD 0.567) and their teachers (m=4.85; SD=.672) had strong belief on the role of using TALT in minimizing FLA. The descriptive analysis of the GAM also revealed that both EFL students (m=6.04; SD 0.513) and their teachers (m=4.3; SD=.572) had positive attitude towards using TALT during teaching-and-learning EFL. However, the qualitative data revealed that the actual practice in using technology assisted language teaching-and-learning trend was found very low and discouraging in both the EFL students and their teachers. Finally, the study ends with practical recommendations for the main actors to use TALT in EFL classes to make the classroom less stressful. © BEIESP.},

People become autonomous by using internet and they can independent from books and teacher such as chartrooms and mass media which increase the oral proficiencies of learners. the use of mass media such as books and manuscripts and internet media (like blogs; message boards; podcasts; and video sharing) are another faces of e-learning. Although using mass media and internet media are challenging and time consuming. They provide teacher and students with creative and practical ideas. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Automatic articulation scoring makes the computer able to give feedback on the quality of pronunciation and eventually detect some phonemes on miss-pronunciation. Computer-assisted language learning has evolved from simple interactive software that access the learner's knowledge in grammar and vocabulary to more advanced systems that accept speech input as a result of the recent development of speech recognition. Therefore many computer based self teaching systems have been developed for several languages such as English, Deutsch and Chinese, however for Arabic; the research is still in its infancy. This study is part of the 'Arabic Pronunciation improvement system for Malaysian Teachers of the Arabic language' project which aims at developing computer based systems for standard Arabic language learning for Malaysian teachers of the Arabic language. The system aims to help teachers to learn the Arabic language quickly by focusing on the listening and speaking comprehension (receptive skills) to improve their pronunciation. In this paper we addressed the problem of giving marks for Arabic pronunciation by using a Automatic Speech Recognizer (ASR) based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM). Therefore, our methodology for pronunciation assessment is based on the HMM log-likelihood probability, however our main contribution was to train the system using both native and non native speakers. This resulted on improving the system's accuracy from 87.61% to 89.69%. © 2013 IEEE.},

With the advent of the computer-based education and online learning methodologies and technologies, providers of education are combining teaching methods to fulfill the needs of their learners. Academic institutions are now increasingly using the Internet and digital technologies to deliver instruction and training. Many instructors are encouraged to design courses in which students can benefit from blended learning, an educational strategy that combines the use of online teaching and learning with the best features of classroom interaction. The use of blended learning was born out of the necessity to accommodate students with learning disabilities who study English for academic purposes (EAP) in higher education.

	abstract = {This study examined the role of learners' perceptions in a learner-controlled computer-based learning environment. Computer-based learning environments that offer learner control (LC) to the learners are assumed to enhance motivation and learning outcomes. Recently, the focus of LC research has shifted from measuring the direct effect of LC on learning towards focusing on the underlying mechanisms of effective LC and determining under which conditions LC is most effective (Corbalan, Kester, & van Merriënboer, 2009). There is considerable agreement that learners' skills, perceptions and the experienced cognitive load interactively affect LC as instructional strategy. For this study, 165 first-year university students participated in an on-line English learning course on verb conjugation. We investigated the effect of learners' perceptions of LC by comparing the learning outcomes and motivation of learners that received additional instructions on learner control with a group of learners that did not receive additional instruction. Learner characteristics, such as prior knowledge, working memory capacity, self-efficacy and cognitive load, were taken into account. The results indicate that it is not instruction as such, but rather satisfaction with the degree of control that affects learning outcomes and motivation. We suggest that instruction as such does not suffice to enhance perception of control, and that learners' perceptions play a mere role in the effectiveness of instructional strategies such as learner control. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Background: In-service training represents a significant financial investment for supporting continued competence of the health care workforce. An integrative review of the education and training literature was conducted to identify effective training approaches for health worker continuing professional education (CPE) and what evidence exists of outcomes derived from CPE.Methods: A literature review was conducted from multiple databases including PubMed, the Cochrane Library and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) between May and June 2011. The initial review of titles and abstracts produced 244 results. Articles selected for analysis after two quality reviews consisted of systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and programme evaluations published in peer-reviewed journals from 2000 to 2011 in the English language. The articles analysed included 37 systematic reviews and 32 RCTs. The research questions focused on the evidence supporting educational techniques, frequency, setting and media used to deliver instruction for continuing health professional education.Results: The evidence suggests the use of multiple techniques that allow for interaction and enable learners to process and apply information. Case-based learning, clinical simulations, practice and feedback are identified as effective educational techniques. Didactic techniques that involve passive instruction, such as reading or lecture, have been found to have little or no impact on learning outcomes. Repetitive interventions, rather than single interventions, were shown to be superior for learning outcomes. Settings similar to the workplace improved skill acquisition and performance. Computer-based learning can be equally or more effective than live instruction and more cost efficient if effective techniques are used. Effective techniques can lead to improvements in knowledge and skill outcomes and clinical practice behaviours, but there is less evidence directly linking CPE to improved clinical outcomes. Very limited quality data are available from low- to middle-income countries.Conclusions: Educational techniques are critical to learning outcomes. Targeted, repetitive interventions can result in better learning outcomes. Setting should be selected to support relevant and realistic practice and increase efficiency. Media should be selected based on the potential to support effective educational techniques and efficiency of instruction. CPE can lead to improved learning outcomes if effective techniques are used. Limited data indicate that there may also be an effect on improving clinical practice behaviours. The research agenda calls for well-constructed evaluations of culturally appropriate combinations of technique, setting, frequency and media, developed for and tested among all levels of health workers in low- and middle-income countries. © 2013 Bluestone et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

This paper summarized the current status of computer application in mathematics education in primary schools in both China and other countries. More than twenty pieces of computer software with exploring and cognitive functions were analyzed. We concluded that although computer-aid learning technologies are relatively mature, the software itself does not cover the full contents and examination capabilities that are required by the primary school education system. With respect to the realization of the supporting software platform of math education, this paper laid out the principles of building such platform. Both the oriented model framework and functional model framework were built, with the key realization techniques discussed.

However, research on the applicability of CAI in the Malaysian context whom majority are non-native English speakers is limited. 29 children with ASD aged four to seven were recruited through purposive sampling from two branches of an autism centre. The present study employed an experimental mixed-design in which the children were assigned to two groups which are CAI and a control group (non-CAI) based on the centre they attended. The CAI group used computer with software program of First Word II while the control group received the conventional teaching instruction. Results of a 2 x 2 mixed ANOVA indicate that there were significant main effects of time (i.e., pre and post intervention) on both participants' receptive and expressive vocabulary learning.

	abstract = {According to a study published by Crystal & Graddol (1997), English is the most common and utilized language in the world. Regarded as the lingua franca, it is seen in social media, academic texts, novels, television, and more. Due to its omnipresence, it is paramount that every citizen must at least have a decent grasp of the language. However, as stated and shown in the Senate Resolution No. 622 filed by Senator Grace Poe (2018), English proficiency has been on a steady decline (p. 2). Instead of combating this using traditional teaching methods, this paper proposes that teachers instead use the storytelling approach. Studies have shown that stories, when it is aligned with one's interests, have a profound effect on a person's ability to understand the language (Gonzales, 2009, p. 105). This paper will focus on determining which type of storytelling will be more effective in teaching English: traditional or digital. Traditional storytelling is the storyteller-listener approach, while digital storytelling is storytelling using computer-based tools. These two types of storytelling were used to test the English proficiency of 2 different sections from the Adult Night High School (ANHS) students of La Salle Green Hills. Using a pre-test borrowed from the Word-Up project, the researchers were able to assess their initial English proficiency level. Afterwards, the students were asked to read the story 'The Monkey's Paw' by W.W Jacobs, one through traditional reading and the other through PowerPoint presentation. The students were then given a post-test made by the researchers themselves to see if they improved, and if one class scored higher than the other. Using T-Test: Two-Sample Assuming Unequal Variances with a 95% level of confidence, the statistical computations show that there is little to no statistical difference between the pre-test and post-test scores of traditional storytelling class and the digital storytelling class. Hence, researchers have failed to reject the null hypothesis, which means that there is little to no significant difference between the effectiveness of digital storytelling and the effectiveness of traditional storytelling. However, this could be attributed to the limitations of the study. Therefore, more research must be done in order to come to a more conclusive result. © 2019 IEEE.},

The researcher applied various techniques in teaching, including a newly developed technique called FBFRP (Turmudi 2013) which basically assist(s) learners in self-regulatory process in writing composition (Magno, 2009). The research goals were to find out some critical points and how each point is qualified among the addressed issues. The primary data were collected with instruments such as tests, reflections, and questionnaires. Thus, the results were a descriptive qualitative with quantitative data output. The subjects were 100 undergraduate students of English Department enrolled in an essay writing class and the data were the students' responses on the addressed points formatted in a rating scale questionnaire (Sugiyono, 2009). There were no statistical inferences reported except for descriptive statistics and logical inferences. The result revealed that none of the components were dominants, but a certain technique as a medium to assist the students' ability to write computer-based-essay test was needed to develop. Thus, this research has the same conclusion with that of Magno (2009) hypothesizing that learners of EFL tend to use specific approach to learning and eventually undergo self-regulatory process. © Asian EFL Journal 2015.},

Computer-based technologies, embracing various forms of computer-mediated communication (CMC), appear to be particularly useful in promoting an intercultural approach, as they provide L2 users with opportunities to access cultural information and engage in authentic intercultural exchanges with other L2 users. The article reports the findings of a study that investigated whether and to what extent advanced EFL learners, English majors from Poland and Romania, made use of information and communication technology (ICT) to enhance their intercultural experience. The results indicate declared high levels of ICT use to get information about the culture of English-speaking countries, but also enhanced interest in other cultures, openness to cultural differences and willingness to communicate with foreigners through CMC. On the basis of the findings, conclusions are drawn about the potential benefits of online experience for the development of L2 learners’ intercultural awareness, although intercultural training within formal instruction is needed to better prepare learners for pursuing intercultural competence development through online resources. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in content processing technology and the widespread diffusion of wired and wireless Internet mean that users can now learn by means of a computer, anytime and anywhere. English learning that involves multimedia content can increase the interest of learners and lead to the development of their communication ability. Although using computers to teach English in a conventional educational environment provides motivation and effective learning on the part of the students, the method still has problems, which include the provision of learning materials without consideration of teaching methods, and evaluation without provision for differences in individual student levels. This paper introduces the Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) for English learning, using web-based technologies. Using this system, the above problems are solved at the same time as the benefits of computer-based learning are retained. Its design and implementation are based on an intelligent tutoring system that provides content suitable for specific levels of ability. We used the contents of the Korean Elementary school 300-certification program for English conversation and an estimation of students' abilities using Item Response Theory (IRT) to evaluate the proposed system. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

These ELs face challenges due to a lack of fluency in decoding, vocabulary, and word, sentence, and discourse level complexities in English learning. Structure strategy instruction on the Web for English Language Learners (SWELL) is a web-based tutoring system that supports ELs in reading comprehension by teaching them about five text structures. In addition SWELL provides two adaptations for ELs - Spanish Scaffolding (where students were presented materials in both Spanish and English) and English Hybrid (where students were given the option of seeking assistance in Spanish by hovering over words, clicking on sentences, or viewing a full page in Spanish). In this paper we report on the design and pilot studies conducted within five classrooms at grades 4,5, and 6.

As players, the learners can "Call Out" for help or assistance; however, online friends hold the decision of "Replying" or "Not to Reply" the players' "Call Outs". This mechanism is so called "Peer Feedback". Results of this study showed that the DGBL incorporated into a social network website is a feasible and sound model for teaching. By the model, English learning will become more interesting which makes students more enjoyable in learning auxiliary materials after school if they cannot fully comprehend the course in the classroom.

This paper aims at summarizing a set of POSTECH approaches including theories, technologies, systems, and field studies and providing relevant pointers. On top of the state-of-the-art technologies of spoken dialog system, a variety of adaptations have been applied to overcome some problems caused by numerous errors and variations naturally produced by non-native speakers. Furthermore, a number of methods have been developed for generating educational feedback that help learners develop to be proficient. Integrating these efforts resulted in intelligent educational robots - Mero and Engkey - and virtual 3D language learning games, Pomy. To verify the effects of our approaches on students' communicative abilities, we have conducted a field study at an elementary school in Korea. The results showed that our CALL approaches can be enjoyable and fruitful activities for students. Although the results of this study bring us a step closer to understanding computer-based education, more studies are needed to consolidate the findings.

Since 2004, the trial instruction on Network-assisted Language Teaching (NALT) Model integrating the English instruction and computer technology has been launched at some universities in China, including China university of Geosciences (Beijing) (CUGB). The purpose of this paper is to provide experimental evidence about whether NALT Model can enhance undergraduate English skills more effectively than the traditional teaching model. In this study, an experimental study is conducted to get the data (students' exam scores from experimental group and control group). Then a comparison method is utilized to analyze the experiment data that is the final examinations of every semester from the fall semester of 2007 to the fall semester of 2008 at CUGB. The results of a separate independent t-test demonstrate significant differences between experimental and control groups in mid-test and post-test with SPSS 11.5. Then a graphical model X ̄S Plane Analysis Model (Li & Xie, 1994) is used to analyze the statistical characteristics of both groups' scores. The results show that the whole distribution of the experimental group's scores in the post-test is totally in the best state. Above study results indicate NALT model is indeed more effective than the traditional classroom teaching model in improving undergraduate English skills. This study contributes to the better realization of the effect of NALT model, and urges researchers to deepen the study of this field in future.},

This paper presents the results of a mobile phone-based intervention conducted in the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu in 2012–13. The BridgeIT project provided a pool of audio-visual learning materials organised in accordance with a system of syllabi pacing charts. Teachers of Standard 5 and 6 English and Science classes were notified of the availability of new videos via text messages (SMS), which they downloaded onto their phones using an open-source application and showed, with suggested activities, to students on a TV screen using a TV-out cable. In their evaluation of this project, the authors of this paper found that the test scores of children who experienced the intervention improved by 0.36 standard deviations in English and 0.98 standard deviations in Science in Andhra Pradesh, relative to students in similar classrooms who did not experience the intervention. Differences between treatment and control schools in Tamil Nadu were less marked. The intervention was also cost-effective, relative to other computer-based interventions. Based on these results, the authors argue that is possible to use mobile phones to produce a strong positive and statistically significant effect in terms of teaching and learning quality across a large number of classrooms in India at a lower cost per student than past computer-based interventions. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning.},

To fill in the gap, this mixed-method study examined the perspectives of 247 Iranian EFL teachers on the implementation of computer-based testing (CBT) in Iranian EFL contexts. Three instruments were used for data collection. The quantitative data were collected using a questionnaire survey to investigate the EFL teachers' perspectives on the implementation of CBT. Follow-up in-depth interviews were conducted with 68 EFL teachers to provide supplementary and qualitative data. A total of 11 EFL syllabi were further analyzed to explore any use of computer-based tests in Iranian EFL courses. Findings indicated that the teachers held positive attitudes toward the implementation of CBT. Several challenges to the implementation of CBT in Iranian language teaching contexts were identified and discussed. The results showed that computer-based tests are not used and developed by Iranian EFL teachers. The participants proposed several strategies and measures which might facilitate the incorporation of CBT in language testing. The findings have implications for the incorporation of CBT in the EFL curriculum.},

The results indicated that the general behaviour of the children with the game was very different for each of the schools while there were no significant differences in subjective opinions or previous computer game experience as measured with a questionnaire. The gaming records and interviews informed that children do enjoy playing the game in comparison with other formal learning activities, but appreciate it less as a leisure-time activity. Furthermore it appears that children used to teacher-initiated activities tend to depend on their teacher's directions for how and when to play. The study highlights the level of choice as one of the important aspects to consider when introducing a game in the classroom. The study also points out some suggestions for the design of educational games, such as providing communication possibilities between players and integrating fast-paced motor-skill based games with learning content in a meaningful way. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The corpus is XML-annotated and contains about 100,000 words of product descriptions of health products, cleaning supplies and products for beauty and personal care, divided into three textual moves: (1) overview, (2) directions and (3) warnings. First, we describe the data collection, corpus design and annotation scheme of the corpus, and then we present the findings of an analysis of CoPI's most frequent words, clusters and its type-token ratio. Finally, we show its potential for language-pedagogic purposes and suggest how the CoPI analyses can be used for paper- and computer-based DDL activities that foster corpus-based genre teaching in the advanced EFL classroom. We conclude this paper by summarising the outcomes of a first case study we conducted to test these activities with advanced learners of English. © Edinburgh University Press.},

Words at Work aims to raise adult English language learners' (ELLs') pragmatic awareness in the English-medium workplace. The study focuses in particular on the pedagogic principles of second-language (L2) instruction underlying the design of the computer-based learning environment and seeks to explore the perceived usefulness of computer-assisted language learning (CALL)–mediated L2 pragmatic instruction, responding to this overarching research question: To what extent do learners feel that Words at Work successfully operationalizes the principles of teaching L2 pragmatics as proposed in the research literature? Accordingly, we first review teaching principles for L2 pragmatics instruction and present an overview of existing stand-alone materials for L2 pragmatics learning and teaching. Then, we outline the development and design features of Words at Work, before presenting the findings of a usability study that was conducted with 19 adult ELLs. We found evidence that users desired immersive learning environments that incorporate authentic audiovisual input, personalized and immediate feedback, and extensive opportunities for interaction and self-reflection. Implications for the design of computer-mediated L2 pragmatic learning tools and tasks will be discussed both for instruction and assessment. © 2019 Educational Testing Service},

At the end of one semester, a pen-and-paper writing task was given to both groups. The results of the post-test revealed that the students who were exposed to computer-based instruction outperformed their counterparts in terms of using appropriate articles, tense, plural forms and spelling.

An experimental design, employing a pretest-posttest control group is employed. Randomly assigned foreign language university majors joined either the experimental group (outdoor ubiquitous learning), with 80 participants (26 males and 54 females), or a control group (indoor computer-assisted learning), with 80 participants (27 males and 53 females). The experiment lasted 3 weeks. Both groups were administered a test of English listening proficiency before and after the experiment along with a questionnaire of cognitive load postexperiment. Prior English listening proficiency forms a covariate for the multivariate analysis of covariance. Results show (a) students in the experimental group exhibit significantly better English listening comprehension after the experiment compared to the control group; (b) students in the experimental group reported significantly lower cognitive load than the control group; (c) English listening comprehension and cognitive load exhibited a statistically significant negative relationship; and (d) outdoor ubiquitous learning enhanced self-reported learning interests and interactions more than indoor computer-assisted learning. Contributions and significances of this study are presented based on these results. Finally, implications for teaching practices are proposed. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {Classical elements permeate global academic discourse and scientific terminology. Understanding the meanings and functioning of these elements can help multilingual scholars cope with disciplinary literature and write for publication and is therefore essential in teaching English for academic and specific purposes. However, few manuals on academic vocabulary explore word-formation in-depth or use it as a tool to alleviate learning through analysis and synthesis rather than memorizing words. Russian, as many other European languages, is a synthetic language in which affixation is as productive as in Latin. The paper presents a well-designed and approbated course of academic vocabulary for social scientists, analyses relationships between linguistic studies and teaching academic vocabulary, and discusses the ways of increasing the effectiveness and clarity of teaching by more systematic study of classical elements, enhancing students’ analytical skills through innovative methodology and using the advantages of similarities between Russian and Latin word-formation. Comparative analysis demonstrates that the key features of the course, such as interactive computer-based visual materials and various analytical tasks involving students’ background knowledge and academic awareness, help students not only decipher unknown words, but also produce neologisms, which is essential in coping with new terminology. Published as a book, Academic Vocabulary for Social Sciences is now available for teachers, students and researchers as a resource for study and self-study. The effectiveness of the approach demonstrates that it can be used as a model to design similar specific vocabulary courses for students of other synthetic languages. © 2019 Vysshee Obrazovanie v Rossii.All right reserved.},

Therefore, in the context of Turkish EFL teachers' perceptions of computer usage in learning and teaching, the current study aims to examine Turkish EFL teachers' knowledge of software and their reasons for personal computer use, including the attitudes and perceptions of self-confidence among teachers in integrating computers and the school climate and support with respect to the use of computers for teaching EFL. The sample group in the study consisted of 157 EFL teachers. Before descriptives were computed, a background questionnaire and survey that assessed the degree of knowledge about the computer software, the frequency of software use for personal purposes, the teachers' attitudes toward and perceived self-confidence in integrating computers, and finally, the school climate and support were used to collect quantitative data. The results indicated that Turkish EFL teachers have little knowledge about certain software and experience difficulties using the software programs and that they suffer from a lack of technical and instructional support, although they have positive perceptions of computer integration and attitudes toward computer use. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Design A systematic review of empirical research across a range of themes in ICT health-related education. Data Sources Science Direct, Cinahl, AMED, MEDLINE, PubMed, ASSIA, OVID and OVID SP (2008–2014). Further date parameters were imposed by theme. Review Methods Evidence was reviewed by narrative synthesis, adopting Caldwell's appraisal framework and CASP for qualitative methods. Selection and inclusion was grounded in the PICOS structure, with language requirements (English), and further parameters were guided by theme appropriateness. Results Fifty studies were selected for review across six domains: reusable learning objects, media, audience response systems, e-portfolios, computer-based assessment and faculty adoption of e-learning. Educational ICT was found to be non-inferior to traditional teaching, while offering benefits to teaching and learning efficiency. Where support is in place, ICT improves the learning environment for staff and students, but human and environmental barriers need to be addressed. Conclusion This review illuminates more advantages for ICT in nurse training than previously. The key advantage of flexibility is supported, though with little evidence for effect on depth of learning. © 2016},

	abstract = {The sociolinguistic development of English has placed a greater emphasis on intelligibility as the ultimate goal of pronunciation instruction. However, various studies have indicated that English pronunciation of Indonesian English learners was not satisfactory due to difficulties in learning English pronunciation and lack of emphasis given to the teaching of English pronunciation in English classrooms in Indonesia. In this paper, we propose the development of Phonetic Alphabets for Bahasa Indonesia (PABI). This practical instrument allows English teachers and students in Indonesia to transcribe the pronunciations of English words into phonetic transcription with locally-appropriate readability and accessibility without compromising the pronunciation intelligibility. The development of PABI started with a contrastive analysis of common phonemes in the two languages, i.e., English and Bahasa Indonesia (BI). Next, we identified the English phonemes missing in Bahasa Indonesia which English learners in Indonesia have to conceptualise. We then located those English sound 'pairs' which seem identical to Indonesians and are thus used interchangeably in BI. A corpus of 30,000 commonly used English words was transcribed in PABI using a computer software IPA to L1PA developed by Rahman and Bhattacharya (2020). Proposals to modify the IPA to suit the BI sound system entailed the adjustments in the consonant phonemes, vowel phonemes, and cluster sounds. These adjustments are expected to improve the readability and accessibility of the conventional IPA in facilitating the teaching and learning of intelligible English pronunciation in Indonesia. Practical uses of the PABI guidelines are drawn to improve its utility. Implications for the development of context-sensitive and locally-appropriate pronunciation teaching and learning are drawn based on the findings. © 2020 Indonesia University of Education.},

This experimental study involves 224 secondary school students in Pekanbaru Riau, Indonesia. A total of 112 students were recruited for the treatment group for using CIRCOM software, and a total of 112 students in the control group for using the conventional method. Data was collected using test questions to measure English achievement and questionnaires to measure student motivation. Data were analyzed by focusing on inferential statistics. The results showed that students using the software CIRCOM have higher motivation than students using the conventional method. The findings also show that there is a difference in academic achievement between students who are highly motivated with students who have low motivation in learning the English language. This showed that there is a positive relationship between motivation and achievement. The findings of this study have implications on everyone who is involved in education to cultivate the habit of using educational technology to improve students' motivation and academic achievement. This study suggests that CIRCOM Software is considered to be used as teaching aids to improve the performance of English secondary school students' motivation. © the author(s).},

Before appropriately implementing any strategy in our case study, a literature review is done to reach an adequate understanding of the state-of-the-art in terms of technology-assisted ESL / TEFL. Next, an appropriately designed questionnaire was used to ascertain the various technological as well as user-centred factors which may impact upon the efficacy and usefulness of such a plan and strategy. Increasingly, students are dependent upon mobile technology for information gathering and communication. How successful can this be in the context of ESL/TEFL?

This study examines students' acceptance of a web-based summative listening test administered in the 2014-2015 academic year within an 'English as a Foreign Language' course at a two-year post-secondary military school in Turkey. The participants consisted of 602 military students. As a model, Computer Based Assessment Acceptance Model based on Technology Acceptance Model was adopted in order to analyze the participants' perceptions on a web-based summative listening comprehension test. The data were collected via an online questionnaire. A structural equation modeling analysis was utilized to analyze the relationships among factors. The general results showed that perceived ease of use and perceived playfulness had a direct influence on the participants' behavioral intentions to use web-based tests. In other words, web-based tests are expected to be used if they are easy to use and playful enough. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Computing education has been expanding into K-12 schools in many countries. The new national curriculum standards in China are going to include computational thinking as a core literacy for every student and make computer programming as a required module in the information technology course. Hence, it is imperative to understand the difficulties Chinese students may face when learning to program. This study investigated Chinese middle students' difficulties in learning to program in Python using the student data in an automated assessment system. Our results showed that the students struggled with fundamental Python syntax and programming rules. We also found that Chinese students faced a special difficulty, which was using correct punctuation symbols in code. We noted that many syntax errors students made were due to the use of Chinese punctuation symbols, which look almost identical to the English equivalents but are invalid to the Python interpreter. Our results suggest that when teaching a programming course to Chinese middle school students, teachers should first help students develop certain typing skills (e.g., switching input methods, distinguishing Chinese and English punctuation symbols, etc.). Such preparation may reduce students' mistakes in code. Finally, future research directions are discussed, including examining the effects of the typing skill training, designing feedback components for the automated assessment system, and so forth. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The second part relates to the subjects that the students have studied prior to participating in this integrated learning course, namely Material Selection, Manufacturing Process, Applied Engineering Drawing, CAD (Computer Aided Design) animation software. Moreover, an intensive cooperation between a lecturer and students is another key factor to fulfill the success of integrated learning. Last but not least, the students need to share their knowledge within the group and among the other groups aiming to gain knowledge of and skills in 1) the application of CAD-software to build up manufacture part drawings, 2) assembly drawing, 3) simulation to verify the strength of loaded pulley by method of Finite Element Analysis (FEA), 4) the software to create animation of mounting and dismounting of a pulley to a shaft, and 5) an instruction manual.

The results show that both DDL types were equally effective for all learners, independent of their proficiency and perceptions, although gains measured by a more controlled production test (gap-filling) were superior to and longer lasting than gains measured by a less controlled production test (sentence-writing). Furthermore, immediate performance gains on different tasks were differently affected by learner proficiency and perceptions, while delayed gains showed no such effects. Finally, the study found that overall learner proficiency increased and that DDL was well received by learners and they expressed an intention to use it for independent learning in the future. This study fills gaps existing in DDL research by focusing on a second language other than English, comparing different DDL types, measuring delayed learning gains, and combining different outcomes measures in a multilevel modeling design. © 2016, Nina Vyatkina.},

The instructional material dealt with modal English language verbs. This research was carried out on a sample size of 68 EFL undergraduates divided into two equal groups namely: experimental (CALL) group and control (TDI) group. The control group was taught with the regular prescribed textbook while the experimental group was given a unique Web-Based instructional material based on Hot Potatoes as a language learning software. Two tests were conducted, pre-test and post-test with both groups at two intervals. The pre-test was undertaken immediately at the end of the instructional period, and a delayed post-test three weeks after the instructional period. Findings revealed that the performance of the experimental; (CALL) group was significantly better than that of the control (TDI) group on both post-tests, however, the performance of both groups on the immediate post-test and delayed post-test had shown a considerable improvement. © 2018, CALL-EJ.

	abstract = {Aim/Purpose In this study, the authors examine how an online word processing tool can be used to encourage participation among students of different language back-grounds, including English Language Learners. To be exact, the paper discusses whether student participation in anonymous collaborative writing via Google Docs can lead to more successful products in a linguistically diverse eighth-grade English Language Arts classroom. Background English Language Learners (ELLs) make up a considerable portion of elemen-tary and secondary public school students, as language and ethnic diversity has become the norm in the United States. The research literature finds that ELLs are statistically behind their monolingual peers on such key language and aca-demic development indicators as writing. Educators and researchers then turn to collaborative writing with the assistance of online technology. Although it is shown in literature to be a worthwhile endeavor for students of all ages and ability levels, no studies have investigated the differences it makes, namely, in comparison to traditional face-to-face collaboration in the classroom, and to anonymous online collaboration in the virtual space. Methodology Through face-to-face, online, and anonymous writing activities, a rubric, and a survey, this quantitative study asks if anonymous collaborative writing, com-pared to other modalities, equalizes participation among students of varying language fluencies, and if anonymous collaborative writing, compared to other modalities, affect student comfort levels. Contribution This builds on research of online collaborative writing tools and suggests that using such tools (Google Docs in particular) is beneficial, especially for students who are building their language abilities. The study further reveals varied degree of success and student comfort level in participating writing tasks in three mo-dalities. Findings We ascertain that students of varying language fluencies participated more equally when they were able to remain anonymous. Face-to-face writing exhibit-ed the highest overall scores, and students enjoyed working on Google Docs. Recommendations for Practitioners Future and current teachers are encouraged to be open to new technologies and be creative in the use of technology to facilitate student learning. They should have the opportunity to participate in the discussion on how, not if, integrating technology impacts the cognitive, social, and cultural dimensions of teaching. Recommendation for Researchers After this initial quantitative study on students' reactions to various modalities of technology-supported writing formats, the next questions to ask may be how students were engaging in dialogues during face-to-face sessions or chat features of Google Docs trials, and what types of edits students are making. Researchers should turn their focus on secondary school classrooms where there is an in-creasing impact of technology-assisted collaborative writing on student learning and teaching pedagogy. Impact on Society As online technology has become an integral part of daily life, it is beneficial to educators, policy makers, and classroom teachers to understand how technology can be integrated in writing programs and to what extent the integration can help boost student motivation and participation. Future Research More longitudinal research on online assisted collaborative writing and addi-tional quantitative data are needed to further understand the complexities of the writing process in-group online writing and the nature of collaboration.},

	abstract = {Teaching and learning using technology has, for some years, been the focus of various researchers. From vocational schools, through basic education to higher education, the use of teaching aids based on information technologies is now a common practice. Today, more than making large computing solutions to support the activities of e-learning, it is important to focus on software specific solutions whose cost of production / implementation has a quick return. In this context the need emerged to move forward with a system to support teaching and learning of foreign languages to facilitate communication between teachers and students. It is on this issue that we present a proposal to develop a computing solution that enables students to develop the skills of reading and speaking foreign languages within the classroom context or outside the classroom. In this specific case we address the English language. We also present a working prototype, which is available as freeware for the educational and the scientific community and can be used without restriction. Experimentally, tests were made with 20 volunteer students from ESTGL. They used the prototype, in order to validate the usability tests. Finally, we present some results that show the progression of learning in those students who used the system. © 2011 AISTI.},

	abstract = {As English has become a crucial international language, many ministerial and educational organizations have agreed that there is a need to improve the competence of Thai people in using English for communicating within the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) and with other global nations. While there is significant research devoted to developing software tools to support the teaching of English as a second language, they are mostly concerned with the formal learning in school. This project focuses on addressing the need to improve the learning of English as a second language to the beginner for Thai rural residents that have never learned English. The target groups of this study were students from primary 4 to primary 6 who were just beginning to learn English. This paper presents the development of an educational software tool which is referred to as situated learning. The tool supports learners in the acquisition and retention of new English vocabulary and conversation knowledge, which is called as situated English vocabulary and conversation learning system (SEVCLS). A sequence of experiments were undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of SEVCLS in improving vocabulary acquisition. Early results are capable with increased learner engagement and performance with the pretest and posttest improvement scores. The initial investigation showed positive user satisfaction. The study believes that individuals learning through their interests will decrease tension and increase attention. Overall, this approach for using SEVCLS in improving vocabulary cognition actually motivates the learner to learn that can be able to improve the learning skill of Thai rural residents. © 2013 IEEE.},

Student explanations were categorized using the Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO) taxonomy. The better programmers were more likely to articulate relational aspects of the algorithms. While earlier work also found such a link, the code writing in those earlier studies was done on paper. This is the first such result where the writing component was done with 'hands on' a computer. Our results add further evidence for the existence of an aspect of reasoning about code that is common to both explaining code and writing code, which in turn suggests that a judicious mix of teaching both code skills and code explaining skills may lead to a more effective process by which novices learn to reason about code.

Assessment for Learning is a teaching approach which enables personalization of learning, sets targets for individual learners and thus helps our bachelor students progress to desired outcomes. Introducing technology as a mediational tool in the process of assessment was an essential step that we have taken in an effort to improve the on-line course of Professional English Language in the university Blackboard LMS. Computer-based formative self-assessment of English language was taken by bachelor students of Tourism Management to periodically test the development of language competencies, to know what skills have been learned and how far have the students progressed in achieving their targets in mastering English as a second language. In evaluating our students’ responses regarding the course quality we found out that targeting test questions at ability level in the on-line course is very motivating for the students. Moreover, for teachers is computer-adaptive testing really useful tool for getting precise, individual information about students’ ability level, whilst providing the added benefits of keeping them engaged and motivated by assessment activity. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.},

	abstract = {Pain is one of the most distressing and debilitating health issues faced by older people. The burden of unrelieved pain experienced by older people and its associated high symptom and economic costs demands consideration of new strategies to better this condition. As the global uptake of digital technology increases, exploring its potential to impact positively on older peoples’ pain self-management practices warrants investigation. This integrative review aimed to evaluate the use of digital health technology for management of older people's pain across care-settings. Searches were conducted to identify relevant English language studies published in CINHAL, Medline, Academic Search Complete, EMBASE, Cochrane library databases, and Google and Google Scholar websites. A total of 1003 papers were identified, 9 met the inclusion criteria. The highest level of evidence (Level II) was generated by three Phase II randomized controlled trials. These trials demonstrated the feasibility of computer based interactive or instructive video interventions however there was limited evidence to support their use for reduction of pain intensity and interference. Qualitative evidence demonstrated older people's willingness to use mobile technologies (iPhone or digital pen) to help manage their pain, however, the need of device-use training and connectedness with clinicians were highlighted. In conclusion, there is some evidence that integrating digital health technology into older peoples’ pain self-management plan is feasible and acceptable. However, the provision of high-quality technological interventions informed by a thorough understanding of older people's digital technology pain management needs is required to ensure greater integration of this technology in clinical practice. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd},

Hence, this chapter describes various principles of effective report design derived from decades of empirical and theoretical research into the communication of complex information to lay readers and users of test reports. These principles have to do with (a) the utility of reports in terms of having clear purpose and explicit guidance for interpretation and subsequent action and (b) clarity of design, guidance, displays and language. These principles are illustrated in the case of the Assessment Tools for Teaching and Learning (asTTle) computer software deployed in New Zealand’s schools since 2002 for teacher and school leader use. The asTTle system (now fully online with computer adaptive testing options) allows teachers to custom-create tests in reading comprehension, mathematics and writing for students in grades 4–11 in either English or Māori, the indigenous language. After score processing, the asTTle system provides a suite of reports which were field tested and for which empirical evidence exists that the reports are useful and clear. This system exploits the principles of effective reporting and leads to more effective formative assessment practices by teachers. © 2019 Taylor & Francis},

It is equally important in the case of electronic services such as e-teaching.

	abstract = {Content-based instruction (CBI) has been widely adopted for decades. However, existing CBI models cannot always be effectively put into practice, especially for learners of lower English proficiency in English as a foreign language (EFL) context. This study examined an animation design course adopting CBI to promote reading abilities of English majors at a technology university in Taiwan. CBI usually adds challenges in cognitive and linguistic learning, especially for English majors in computer courses. Different from other CBI courses, this course dealt with multiple situations: multi-approaches (CBI and task-based instruction); multi-skills (Flash animation software skills- various animation effects; language skills-computer vocabulary and reading comprehension); multi-level learners (various English language proficiency levels – mostly low proficiency level; computer abilities; learning styles), and a large class taught by one instructor. Simply employing CBI cannot solve such complex problems. Therefore, instructional streaming video was applied as a learner-directed scaffold and a technological facilitator. A control group and an experimental group comprised 117 and 121 English majors taking this course for one semester respectively. Both groups were taught with English materials but the later were additionally provided with instructional streaming video (ISV). Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from classroom observations, interviews, exams, and semester-end questionnaires from both groups to examine whether ISV facilitated instructor teaching and student learning. Results show that the experimental group significantly performed better in reading comprehension, reading speed, acceptance, attention, and exams, as well as easing teaching difficulties. Drawn upon empirical results, a technology-assisted sheltered model was generated for EFL multi-purpose courses. © 2016, 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

The dynamic development of technology has irreversibly tied language learning and teaching to the computer software, which has important implications for both language teachers and students. Anyone concerned with second language teaching and learning has to become familiar with the nature of technology-mediated courses. The computer-based tasks included in these courses engage learners in interactive language acquisition, and teachers in the supervision of learning process and assessment of the learners' progress. Many of online courses, especially those for ESP, are the result of EU-funded international projects. Examples of these are English for Chemists, English for Conservation Science, and English for Therapists. This paper describes the development of an e-learning course for therapeutic professionals. The key issues which will be discussed are: the stages of developing an online course, the choosing of course content, and, lastly, the pedagogical framework of the course, including input resources and types of interactive exercises to be used in the course. © Common Ground, Ewa Donesch-Jezo, Iwona Misztal.},

The steps of the project were the following: Firstly, the integration of computerized tools in the curriculum of the two university subjects. Secondly, the implementation of this learning experience was based on a corpus of selected texts which were annotated to help and guide students in their work (the World of Texts); and a database used by students to deal with lexical analysis and to record their findings and their knowledge about lexical items from the texts compiled (the Web of Words). By integrating ICT in the teaching process, we expected to foster students’ autonomy and motivation as well as to improve their lexical and semantic competence. The research results suggest that, in the first place, the computer-mediated format increased students’ motivation and encouraged autonomy in the learning process; in addition, it contributed to a better understanding of both subjects. © 2013 ASOC ESPANOLA LIGUISTICA APLICADA.

	abstract = {Among educational technological tools, there is much discussion about using computers in detecting and correcting learner errors in English as a foreign language (EFL, henceforth) setting. Computer-aided error analysis can be a potent tool in classrooms in Saudi Arabia where the average student-teacher ratio is as lopsided as 40:1. Inevitably, the teaching-learning environment is not conducive to much of the behind-the-scenes teaching part such as correction work. Computer error analysis (CEA, henceforward) is a much-needed impetus for teachers to find errors and enhance their teaching methodology by devoting greater time and attention to real time learner interaction. This paper provides a theoretical framework for using computer software in error analysis with EFL writing output. It discusses the types of writing errors, which occur in EFL classrooms and how these writing errors could be detected and removed with the help of computer software. It examines and compares the error detection in manually processed learners' academic writing with a small sample of twelve scripts from the second year Academic Writing students of English at Qassim University. It provides a ready database of freely available online error analysis tools from which EFL teachers at KSA may select the most viable, suited to their learners and their output. Finally, the study discusses briefly the pedagogical implications and puts forth some supportive recommendations that may allow for inclusion of computers in EFL classrooms in a bigger way than the current practice. © 2020 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.},

This paper reports on a one-year study that aimed at investigating the development of young Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) learners’ reading competence within a Technology-Enhanced Learning Environment (TELE). A total of ten EFL students aged 9 to 12 years old participated in the research, all of which were officially diagnosed with ADHD syndrome. The study concludes by presenting explicit teaching and testing accommodations that could be adopted from primary to tertiary one. As such, the included suggestions aspire to yield practical guidance and insight to EFL instructors, material developers and curricula designers from primary to tertiary education in reference to specific computer-based features embedded in reading comprehension activities that might prove helpful to ADHD learners throughout their lives. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

While the benefits of implementing an online discussion board in teaching have been well-documented, investigation into the social aspects of online learning environments is still needed in order to develop a deeper understanding of how group dynamics affect the overall learning experience. Accordingly, this action research project was designed to explore the perceptions of graduate students concerning the use of an online discussion board, focusing on whether the character of the interactions evidenced in the content of the discussion was reflected in the participants' views of their experiences. The messages posted to the discussion forum were examined via discourse analysis, while the perceptions of the participants were interrogated through self-administered interviews. The results revealed that while positive group dynamics appeared to be prevalent in the discussion, the perceptions of the individual class members did not always agree with this view. In light of the findings, the researcher outlines some possible solutions for creating an online environment that is conducive to learning for members of a discussion forum with disparate levels of experience, as well as some suggestions for further research. © 2013 Association for Educational Communications and Technology.},

Data were collected through a mixed-methodology approach involving five case-study schools and a survey of 112 classroom music teachers in England. Findings outline both positive and negative aspects of using computer technology to compose, such as how it was often perceived as a shortcut; however it can be argued that the computer software encourages a linear approach to composing, and the unrealistic Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) sounds can be a demoralising factor for students’ creativity. © 2019 Intellect Ltd Article.},

	abstract = {To date, computer-based analyses of learner language have mainly concentrated on studying the Indo-European languages, mainly English. However, when we aim to analyse the features that exist in the learner production no matter what their mother tongue backgrounds are (i.e. learner language universals), we should compile and analyse also other, non-Indo-European databases of learner language. This overview introduces the International Corpus of Learner Finnish (ICLFI). The ICLFI is one of the major corpora representing Baltic-Finnic learner language, the others being the Estonian Interlanguage Corpus (EIC) and the Corpus of National Certificate Tests (CEFLING project). The compilation of the ICLFI started in 2007 in the project Corpus study on language-specific and universal features in learner language. The data is being compiled with the help of Finnish language teachers working at foreign universities. The corpus consists of the texts written by learners of Finnish, produced spontaneously in the language learning situations. So far (September 2011), the ICLFI contains circa one million words and texts from speakers of 22 different mother tongues. The text types vary from iction to non-iction. In addition to the texts, the corpus includes a whole range of metatextual information on different variables; this information is encoded in the header of every text file. The variables are learner variables (e.g. age and mother tongue), learning context variables (e.g. teacher's mother tongue), and task variables (e.g. genre and reference tools). These data give the opportunity to study the effect of, for example, the mother tongue background and the proiciency level on the learner's learning process and production. The article discusses also corpus typology, according to which learner corpora can be described and categorized. Furthermore, also corpus annotation and proiciency level analysis are discussed. The information retrieved from the ICLFI can be utilized in actual language teaching situations, as well as in textbook writing and dictionary compilation.},

Training was designed based on the theoretical framework of the Competition Model and a cognitive linguistic analysis of prepositions. Sixty-four Cantonese-speaking intermediate learners of English were trained using a sentence–picture matching task. They received one of the three types of feedback: schematic diagram feedback, metalinguistic rule feedback, or correctness feedback. Only the schematic diagram feedback group was exposed to chaining between spatial senses and nonspatial senses. Results showed that instruction was effective in all three feedback groups, as measured by a cloze test and a translation test. In the translation test, the group receiving schematic diagram feedback outperformed the correctness feedback group. The effects of the three feedback conditions were not significantly different in the cloze test. © 2018 Language Learning Research Club, University of Michigan},

Visualizations of this information in the form of knowledge maps based upon generally accepted rules of knowledge map can then be displayed and contrasted using the system interface to enter user queries. The system is then tested in a blended classroom of native Korean speakers. Data on student learning experiences are then gathered by means of a questionnaire and analyzed in order to assess the overall success of knowledge acquisition in this setting.

Design/methodology/approach – Two types of analysis were conducted in the study: method and data quality analysis. Findings – While interviews alone can inquire into the research problem, the results of this study indicate that the technique is practical and able to generate rich image and textual data, supplementing data from interviews. Based on the results, it is argued that computer-based image elicitation can potentially be used as a viable technique for investigating the problematic issue of the strong preference for native English teachers in the field of English language teaching, particularly its racial aspect. Research limitations/implications – This pilot study gives methodological insights to researchers who aim to investigate relevant issues. Originality/value – In relation to the issue, there has been no previous research employing visual methods in its inquiry. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

However, its adoption, still poses problems and challenges, such as the quality evaluation of the resulting learning applications. In this paper, we discuss the establishment of a method for evaluating the quality of mobile learning applications. The development of the method was based on a systematic review of quality characteristics of mobile learning applications, which resulted in a quality characteristics catalog for this type of application. The proposed quality method comprises: (i) a quality model, which establishes a well-defined set of criteria and requirements; (ii) metrics, i.e., the quality requirements are mapped into attributes that can be measured. To make the measurements was developed a checklist, which comprises 80 questions, classified into eight different groups responsible for the establishment of quality criteria; and (iii) judgment criteria, i.e., for each defined checklist answer a punctuation is assigned, allowing the question to receive a value characterizing its level of quality. The method was applied in the evaluation of three mobile applications for English teaching: Duolingo, Wingua, and Rosetta Stone. In order to evaluate these three applications, they have been tested by a specialist in the software quality area and for each of the applications, the proposed checklist was answered. From the results obtained, we can conclude that the method proposed is adequate for evaluating the quality of mobile learning applications. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This study is based on a survey of the Communicative English Language Certificate (CELC) course run by the Foreign Language Training Center (FLTC), a Project under the Ministry of Education, Bangladesh. FLTC is working to promote the teaching and learning of English through its eleven computer-based and state of the art language laboratories. As Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) is becoming increasingly popular in many EFL/ESL contexts, the fully computer based language teaching facilities offered by FLTC can be seen as a significant step towards implementing CALL in the soil of Bangladesh. However, any language course using technology alone may not always ensure the best practices of language teaching and learning; the advantages of technological advancements are to be adapted according to the pedagogic needs of the concerned language course. This paper, therefore, seeks to explore how aspects of CALL are being integrated within a framework of Communicative Language Teaching (CLT). The survey was conducted on 425 learners who had completed the CELC course at the selected four centers of FLTC. This study provides a brief overview of how computers are being used for teaching communicative English. It is found that the trainees gave a positive response about the contents, facilities, and organization of the course but not completely satisfied with the teaching techniques and participants' role as independent learners. It is recommended that there is a need for making the computer based learning materials more accessible to the learners so that they can use them more independently in and outside the language lab.},

In this study, we firstly collected the criteria on evaluating game-based vocabulary learning from the previous research. Sixty-six criteria are chosen and divided into four dimensions (teaching, game, society, and technology) and fourteen categories. Next, some criteria are selected from the sixty-six ones through English teachers.

In an attempt to 'catch them before they fall', an early reading project was initiated in four kindergarten classes, in a low-SES bilingual school (English/French as a second language), where minority language children form a majority. The project included: (1) teaching reading and writing to kindergarten students, and outcome research: individual pre- and post-treatment assessment using a computer software to measure phonological processing and decoding skills; (2) reading testing of grade 1 students, graduates of traditional kindergartens with no explicit reading instruction programs. Statistical analyses of the pre- and post-tests showed that in only 9 weeks the kindergarten students were able to learn phonological skills critical to the reading process. By contrast, a significant number of the grade 1 students, all graduates of a traditional kindergarten, showed serious reading lags on a group reading test, indicating that early reading instruction is justifiable for this high-risk student population.

The tool attempts to provide users with more opportunities for expressive visualisation than previous educational software; its design was motivated by earlier work connecting "moving image literacy" with print literacy, and it was used here in storywriting preparation work: users first visualised a known story, then wrote their versions of it based on the cartoons they had made. The stories produced are compared with stories written using two other preparation activities, one a pencil-and-paper cartooning exercise and the other a teacher's normal planning session, which also resulted in a retelling of a known story. The study finds that no one preparation process had a noticeably different effect on the final written stories; however, the cartoons produced with the software are found to be quite different to their paper counterparts, showing a greater variety of character action, pose and interaction, slightly more variety of camera shot distance, and more pictures. Children's and teachers' reactions to the software tool are also discussed. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Research was carried out across a range of school subjects: English, history, geography, mathematics, modern foreign languages, music and science. Within this paper we report on the work of two teachers within the same primary school who devised an initiative to support the development of composition skills of children aged 10 and 11, using Dance eJay software. We explore the ways in which collaborations took place between the pupils, arguing that eJay provides a rich mediational tool where creative outcomes are negotiated. We suggest that the computer workstation provides the mediational means by which all pupils - whether or not they possess formal instrumental skills - can be creative, working within a musical style in which they are culturally located. Furthermore, we propose that the teacher is central to the creative-collaborative process and suggest implications for teachers when planning for creative, collaborative work in the classroom using music software such as eJay. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {While computers are often seen as a panacea for many of the limitations of secondary education, research has shown that poor implementation of computer-assisted instruction can decrease student learning. School systems that implement computer technology into their teaching processes need to consider issues such as the nature of the academic content, the sequencing of its presentation, the technological experience of the students, the usability of the computer software and hardware, and the type of feedback provided to students. Software applications must be selected judiciously for best results. This research has two components. In the first study, a broad-based, naturalistic implementation of computer assisted instruction in a high school was investigated. The study covered several course subjects, academic tracks, and student grade levels. Student performance was compared using final course grades for each student. The results showed differential affects of computer-assisted instruction depending on student grade level and track. The second component was a strictly controlled study of eleventh grade students' performance on weekly English vocabulary tests. In this controlled study, students' grades were significantly improved by the computer-assistance software. These studies support the hypothesis that computer-assisted instruction can be used to improve student learning, but suggest that implementation must follow specific guidelines.},

	abstract = {The teaching of literature through CAI raises problems of both a linguistic and instructional nature; student involvement and creativity in studying literature, and especially poetry, is difficult to build into a computer-based lesson. We have confronted these difficulties in the lesson Poetry I, which introduces undergraduates to basic concepts of poetic verse in a design using screen display, speech synthesis, and verse processing to maximize interactivity and student involvement. The lesson contains instructional modules which include the student's composition of a limerick. Computational processing of the limerick's text enables the program to offer guidance as the student composes and revises the verse and gains first-hand experience with metrical language. The significant problems inherent in processing verse are addressed by adapting Digital Equipment Corporation's DECTalk speech synthesizer as an engine converting natural language verse text into accessible strings of phonemic symbols. Although the verse processor cannot "scan" verse, it can interpret DECTalk's symbols reliably enough to successfully stimulate students' thinking about their verse compositions. Preliminary responses to the program have been favorable and demonstrate its effectiveness in involving students more deeply in learning about poetic verse. This suggests that the techniques of verse processing prototyped in Poetry I might be usefully extended to other types of verse and levels of study. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

The examination of this learning process was based on the Biggs and Moore's teaching-learning model (Biggs & Moore, 1993). Aim. The research aims to explore the use of the deep and surface strategies in an Internet environment among EFL students who come from different socio-economic backgrounds. The results of the research may add an additional level to the understanding of students' functioning in the Internet environment. Sample. One hundred fourty-eight Israeli junior and high school students participated in this research. Methods. The methodology was based on special computer software: Screen Cam, which recorded the students' learning process. In addition, expert judges completed a questionnaire which examined and categorized the students' learning strategies. Results. The research findings show a clear preference of participants from all socio-economic backgrounds towards the surface learning strategy. The findings also showed that students from the medium to high socio-economic background used both learning strategies more frequently than low socio-economic students. Conclusions. The results reflect the habits that students acquire during their adjustment process throughout their education careers. A brief encounter with the Internet learning environment apparently cannot change norms or habits, which were acquired in the non-Internet learning environment. © 2006 The British Psychological Society.},

What seemed like a straightforward and exciting virtual connection, however, became an exercise in negotiating a number of "real" boundaries (technological, institutional, and theoretical) and, ultimately, revealed important and difficult questions about the uses of computer-based resources such as the Internet for writing instruction and for high school-university collaborations in the teaching of writing. This article describes the difficulties encountered and explores questions raised by the project about use of computer technologies in teaching writing and about purposes of writing instruction more generally.},

Members of three year cohorts (Years 8, 10 and 12) in six English secondary schools took part in focus group interviews during the first half of 2000. The views elicited in the course of the 27 interviews are summarized in terms of six themes. Pupils saw computer-based tools and resources as helping not just to effect tasks and improve presentation, but also to refine work and trial options. They associated the use of such tools and resources with changes in working ambience and classroom relations, as well as with raised interest and increased motivation on their part. Finally, while pupils welcomed opportunities for independent working mediated by ICT in which they could engage more directly with appropriately challenging tasks, they were concerned that this reshaping of learning might be displacing valuable teaching. © 2003, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Design/methodology/approach The evidence-based scenario design framework is presented and demonstrated by using BELLA, a new assessment-based gaming environment aimed at supporting student learning of vocabulary and math. BELLA integrates assessment and learning into an interactive gaming system that includes written conversations, math activities, oral and written feedback in both English and Spanish, and a visible psychometric model that is used to adaptively select activities as well as feedback levels. This paper also reports on a usability study carried out in a public middle school in New York City. Findings The evidence-based, scenario design framework proves to be instrumental in helping combine game and assessment requirements. BELLA demonstrates how advances in artificial intelligence in education, cognitive science, educational measurement, and video games can be harnessed and integrated into valid instructional tools for the classroom. Research limitations/implications This paper provides initial evidence of the potential of these kinds of assessment-based gaming tools to enhance teaching and learning. Future work involves exploring student learning effects in randomized controlled studies and comparing the internal assessment models to more traditional assessment instruments. Originality/value BELLA is the first step toward achieving engaging, assessment-based, gaming environments for a variety of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM)-related areas with explicit support for English language learners. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

It focuses particularly on citizenship classes and the tension between the framing by politicians of the test as an entitlement for migrants which ensures access to their full set of rights, and the experience of the testing regime by those affected by it.

Thus, Integrated Courseware Engineering Systems (ICES) satisfy Computer- Aided Learning principles, in particular by taking into account multimedia improvements, software engineering, artificial intelligence and Human- Computer Interface aspects. They provide adequate means of cooperation between the various actors (pedagogues, instructors, software engineers, ...) thanks to specific methodologies based on prototyping (spiral life cycle) and thanks to capabilities of reuse and guiding within the global process. We apply these general principles while focusing on a specific stage of educational software lifecycle: that of specification. The environment can enhance the capabilities of the pedagogues as they define the major aims of a piece of educational software through inferences on the formalized methodological framework and through the reuse of pedagogical components. The framework can be adapted according to different ways of teaching as we try to demonstrate with an example of teaching English for Specific Purposes. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1996.},

Teachers and teaching assistants used either Additional Literacy Support (ALS), a highly structured set of small group teaching materials devised by the English National Literacy Strategy, or a wide variety of other materials including other published intervention programmes, reading scheme-based, computer-based and individually designed interventions, or a combination of ALS and other interventions. The influence of a broad range of contextual factors were investigated, especially whether children's qualities, school factors such as socio-economic status and class size, and delivery differences made significant differences to the outcomes of the different interventions. The study used a naturalistic quasi-experimental design, in which teachers were asked to record details of their children and interventions without altering their professional decisions, which has not been used before in investigating literacy difficulties in context. ALS was marginally more effective than other interventions in the majority of classes, but was clearly superior in value for money terms. Children's qualities did not appear to affect outcomes. Although children receiving additional help made better than average progress, overall catch-up was limited, especially in spelling. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an online course for assessing and developing lexical competence which grew out of one simple question: How many words do our students have? We start by highlighting the importance of vocabulary teaching in the second language learning process and the beneficial effects of multimedia on developing lexis. The first response to the aforementioned query took the shape of a research study which evaluated the lexical competence of students in their final year of an English Philology degree course. As a result, the lecturers involved in the project undertook a further study entitled ADELEX1 - “Assessing and Developing Lexical Competence through the Internet” - aiming to develop a web-based course that would improve the vocabulary levels of our students (http://www.ugr.es/~inped/index.htm). The instructional design of the online vocabulary project, ADELEX, developed through Web Course Tools (WebCT), is detailed in the second part of the paper. First we set out its pedagogical objectives and describe the main characteristics of this modular course. We then address the issue of syllabus design describing its lexicographical, lexicological, semantic and discoursal contents, and offer a brief profile of its nine modules. Needless to say, we establish some methodological guidelines for the implementation of a virtual course which may help students control their own learning and provide constant feedback and interaction. In fact, learner autonomy is one of its main objectives. In addition, its teaching procedures are examined, emphasizing the tools of WebCT: online assignments, forums, online vs. on campus sessions, students' projects, grading, test design, etc. An unavoidable research question is also addressed: how to assess lexical competence both at the diagnostic level, to obtain initial feedback, and at the achievement level, i.e. when a word can be said to be acquired in a web-based environment. The answer to this question has been to develop a complex system of computer-based tests (CBTs). Finally, we draw some pedagogic conclusions. © 2004, Cambridge University Press.

	abstract = {Background. Computer-based teaching (CBT) is a well-known educational device, but it has never been applied systematically to the teaching of a complex, rare, genetic disease, such as Hunter disease (MPS II). Aim. To develop interactive teaching software functioning as a virtual clinic for the management of MPS II. Implementation and Results. The Hunter disease eClinic, a self-training, user-friendly educational software program, available at the Lysosomal Storage Research Group (http://www.lysosomalstorageresearch.ca), was developed using the Adobe Flash multimedia platform. It was designed to function both to provide a realistic, interactive virtual clinic and instantaneous access to supporting literature on Hunter disease. The Hunter disease eClinic consists of an eBook and an eClinic. The eClinic is the interactive virtual clinic component of the software. Within an environment resembling a real clinic, the trainee is instructed to perform a medical history, to examine the patient, and to order appropriate investigation. The program provides clinical data derived from the management of actual patients with Hunter disease. The eBook provides instantaneous, electronic access to a vast collection of reference information to provide detailed background clinical and basic science, including relevant biochemistry, physiology, and genetics. In the eClinic, the trainee is presented with quizzes designed to provide immediate feedback on both trainee effectiveness and efficiency. User feedback on the merits of the program was collected at several seminars and formal clinical rounds at several medical centres, primarily in Canada. In addition, online usage statistics were documented for a 2-year period. Feedback was consistently positive and confirmed the practical benefit of the program. The online English-language version is accessed daily by users from all over the world; a Japanese translation of the program is also available. Conclusions. The Hunter disease eClinic employs a CBT model providing the trainee with realistic clinical problems, coupled with comprehensive basic and clinical reference information by instantaneous access to an electronic textbook, the eBook. The program was rated highly by attendees at national and international presentations. It provides a potential model for use as an educational approach to other rare genetic diseases. © 2010 Al-Jasmi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {We describe a framework for the design of a software tool to support reasoning about the causes of historical events by pupils aged 11-14 as they construct and manipulate diagrammatic representations of those events. Our approach demonstrates that applying relevant theories of teaching and learning can bring order to data collected from the field, and thereby provide a cohesive foundation for detailed software design. Determining the optimal way in which the computer might foster pupils' causal reasoning required a theory-informed understanding of the pedagogical process at three levels: (1) the physical and conceptual space within which teaching and learning take place (a Zone of Proximal Development), (2) the activities taking place within that space ("modelling-supporting-fading"), and (3) the verbal and nonverbal exchanges ("conversations") that form the essence of these activities. Mapping these levels to each other produced a set of fundamental design issues which were then validated against field data in order to determine the computer's role as active partner and/or mediating artefact in these pedagogical conversations. An initial software prototype, in which the computer assumes the latter role only, has been developed and successfully evaluated with pupils studying the causes of the English Civil War. Design of a second prototype, in which the computer is more actively engaged in the conversation, is currently in progress. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

The method is designed to help children with speech and hearing disorders gain better control over their speech production. The teaching method is drawn up for progression from individual sound preparation to practice of sounds in sentences for four languages: English, Swedish, Slovenian, and Hungarian. The system is a general language-independent measuring tool and database editor, This database editor makes it possible to construct modules for all participant languages and for different sound groups. Two modules are under development for the system in all languages: one for teaching and training vowels to hearing-impaired children and the other for correction of misarticulated fricative sounds. In the article we present the measuring methods, the used distance score calculations of the visualized speech spectra, and problems in the evaluation of the new multimedia tool.},

Data from students addressing the use of WebCT in their classes are now available for three full semesters, providing an expanded assessment over earlier findings. The ramifications of the use of WebCT as a course adjunct and course presentation tool are addressed based upon the data collected from Creighton University students over the past 18 months of WebCT use.},

In this paper, we discuss our experience with using a computer game construction environment as a vehicle to encourage female participation in Computing Science. Experiments with game construction in grade 10 English classes showed that females enjoyed this activity as much as males and were just as successful. In this paper, we argue that: a) computer game construction is a viable activity for teaching higher-order thinking skills that are essential for Science; b) computer game construction that involves scripting teaches valuable Computing Science abstraction skills; c) this activity is an enjoyable introduction to Computing Science; and d) outcome measures for this activity are not male-dominated in any of the three aspects (higher-order thinking, Computing Science abstraction skills, activity enjoyment). Therefore, we claim that this approach is a viable gender-neutral approach to teaching Computing Science in particular and Science in general that may increase female participation in the discipline. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Unfortunately their background in English is not enough to develop a clear correlation between programming languages sentences and the control structures they denote. Examples in textbooks represent traditional games or daily situations not usual in our country. For example, card games are played with a different set of clubs, numbers and faces, dice game like craps are practically unknown for teenagers and our grading system has nothing like a GPA.

	abstract = {Traditionally, the teaching of vocabulary has concentrated on the implicit and explicit paradigms. The first one is concerned with natural exposure to language, and is mainly developed through reading (Ma & Kelly, 2006). On the other hand, the explicit approach entails direct teacher intervention through the design of different types of activities (decontextualised, semi-contextualised and contextualised) which normally aim to promote the mastery of high-frequency vocabulary and which require more mental effort to establish the link between form and meaning (Ma & Kelly, 2006). Hence, in this paper we start by revising the aforementioned traditional schools for teaching vocabulary. Moreover, this is followed by the proposal of a third paradigm, the computer-based approach, as, in fact, vocabulary has always been very popular in CALL. In this regard, we refer to a second-generation CALL program developed by the authors with the acronym "ADELEX -Assessing and Developing Lexical Competence through New Technologies-". This program has been designed at the University of Granada to enhance the lexical competence of students of English Philology (cf. Pérez Basanta, 2004). In conjunction with teaching trends, there has been an interest in learning theories in the field of vocabulary teaching, particularly concerning the processes by which lexical knowledge is internalised in what is now called the "mental lexicon". It is widely accepted today that the more we know about vocabulary acquisition from a psycholinguistic perspective, the more teaching and learning will benefit from it (Pérez Basanta, 2003). Therefore, the second part of this paper is devoted to highlight some of the mainstream psycholinguistic assumptions involving the mental processes individuals go through when acquiring words ("context availability", "imaginability hypothesis", "depth of processing", etc.) and their implications in web-based vocabulary processing. We claim that online materials can provide rich and contextual input and they are an important source for learnability as they establish the link between form, meaning and mental representation through authentic and interactive tasks. © Common Ground, María Moreno Jaén, Carmen Pérez Basanta.},

	abstract = {The paper discusses a blended learning concept for a university teacher training course for prospective teachers of English. The concept aims at purposeful learning using different methods and activities, various traditional and electronic media, learning spaces covering contact and distance learning, and task-based learning modules that begin with multimedia-based case stories. The learning concept is based on theories of situated learning in multimedia-enhanced learning environments. The activities discussed include classroom recordings and multimedia-based case stories, an electronic interview with an expert who is an experienced grammar school teacher, and mini-practices, which implement micro teaching in a classroom setting. Case stories used as a didactic tool in teacher education are supposed to contribute to a closer and more reflective relationship between theory-driven and practically-oriented aspects of teacher education. The multimedia-based case stories are hypertexts designed as essential components of computer-based learning modules that support various ways and styles of learning. Students worked with the case story material either in guided or in self-regulated scenarios several times during the course. Three types of learners could be distinguished: students who mainly create and apply experiences, students who mainly study the theoretical resources, and students who create with focused selection of resources. The e-interview promotes an exchange between theory and practical teaching and experience with this format of elearning at the same time. The mini-practice offers guided insights into analyzing teaching materials, hands-on experiences with lesson planning and the experience of acting as a teacher in an authentic teaching context. Furthermore, the mini-practice is meant to help the students broaden their perspectives on “English lessons at school” and change their perspective, that is, from a pupil's to a prospective teacher's. These activities combine contact learning and interactive elearning. This combination is highly appreciated by our learners and represents our concept of integrated interactive elearning and contact learning. © 2005, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {South Africa is a multilingual country. Apart from two official languages, there are seven major languages. The latter group form part of the so-called Southeastern Bantu languages. When students with a Bantu language background start their university careers, they face a very serious communication problem because the medium of instruction is English. This means that they have to study in an ESL situation. In many cases English may even be a third language because they often speak more than one vernacular language. Students who enroll for courses in a faculty of Science are in the situation where they need English for Science and Technology (EST). In the beginning of 1979 Control Data Corporation (U.S.A.) introduced their PLATO Education System in South Africa. Their main interest was to offer people whose native language was not one of the official languages, viz. English and Afrikaans (the latter originated from Dutch), opportunities for educational upgrading. This area of interest led to a number of problems that called for immediate attention. Among these was the need for ESL course materials. The English materials available on PLATO were not ESL materials. Furthermore, the students' lack of proficiency in English made it difficult for them to benefit from excellent courses in many other subject areas. © 1982.},

	abstract = {The article is intended to familiarize test-users with the issues they need to consider when employing assessments for screening/admission purposes. The article examines the purpose, content, and scoring methods of three English as a second language admission tests - the Cambridge certificate exams, International English Language Testing System, and Test of English as a foreign language-computer-based test - and discusses reliability and validity considerations salient to each instrument. The validity and reliability discussion is guided by the "Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing" (1999). The article indicates that the scores obtained from these assessments are used to help make critical decisions that affect test-takers' lives. It is critical, therefore, that these scores provide high quality information. Developers of large-scale tests such as those reviewed in the present article have the responsibility to: construct instruments that meet professional standards; continue to investigate the properties of their instruments and the ensuing scores; and make test manuals, user guides and research documents available to the public. Test-users also have a responsibility. Test-users need to be cognizant of the properties of the instruments they employ and ensure appropriate interpretation and use of test scores provided. Test-users need to carry out local investigations to make sure that their admission requirements are based on an informed analysis of their academic programs and the language ability score profiles necessary to succeed in these programs. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Many educational games focus on teaching language, mathematics, science and cognitive skills. However there is a lack of local educational games. Most educational games are imported from overseas and are situated in foreign contexts. There are also few computer games, which utilize fables and folklore to tell stories in the game, even less so locally. This paper explores the use of local fables in educational computer games to teach English among Year 2 students in an international school. Based on findings from a survey and interview with the students and their teacher, an educational game incorporating characteristics of fables and game design principles was designed. User perceptions obtained indicate that game design principles apply well even to educational and moralistic learning such as fables.},

This article presents a generalised summary of the working methods and outcomes of the institutional case studies, focusing mainly on educational rather than economic contexts and issues. The research confirmed that information technology assisted teaching and learning should be viewed as an intricate and repeated set of innovations applied to complex and rapidly changing interdependent systems. As a result, the full costs and benefits have not been considered by institutions. It is recommended that staff and institutional developments are synchronised through strategic management of change and that aims, partnerships and educational processes are revisited and reformulated so as to maximise opportunities and minimise impediments. © 1999, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Previous research examining different aspects of technology-assisted learning has found equivocal results concerning its effectiveness and outcomes. We extend prior studies by conducting a longitudinal field experiment to compare technology-assisted with face-to-face learning for students' learning of English. Our comparative investigation focuses on learning effectiveness, perceived course learnability, learning-community support, and learning satisfaction. In addition, we analyze the effects of different learning styles in moderating the effectiveness of and satisfaction with technology-assisted learning. Overall, our results show significantly greater learning effectiveness with technology-assisted learning than with conventional face-to-face learning. Learning style has noticeable influences on the effectiveness and outcomes of technology-assisted learning. We also observe an apparently important interaction effect with the medium for delivery, which may partially explain the equivocal results of previous research. © 2007 IEEE.},

In a four-week computer-based training, the efficacy of spelling pronunciations and previewing the spelling patterns on learning to spell loan words in Dutch, originating from French and English, was examined in skilled and less skilled spellers with varying ages. Reading skills were taken into account. Overall, compared to normal pronunciation, spelling pronunciation facilitated the learning of the correct spelling of irregular words, but it appeared to be no more effective than previewing. Differences between training conditions appeared to fade with older spellers. Less skilled young spellers seemed to profit more from visual examination of the word as compared to practice with spelling pronunciations. The findings appear to indicate that spelling pronunciation and allowing a preview can both be effective ways to learn correct spellings of orthographically unpredictable words, irrespective of age or spelling ability.

	abstract = {The primary mission of the University of Wisconsin-Madison Technical Japanese Program is to train English-speaking scientists and engineers to read technical documents written in Japanese. Semester-long courses in technical Japanese at the basic, intermediate, and advanced levels are now being offered live and interactively to students and professionals throughout the United States. Audiographic teleconferencing employs standard microcomputer hardware and a high quality sound system to share audio and visuals with many people simultaneously. Pictures, text in any writing system, data, and high-resolution graphics are transmitted to participants at multiple, remote locations over ordinary telephone lines. Visuals can be annotated during the class using a graphics tablet. Alternatively, the same computer-generated image can be fed to a satellite and then broadcast throughout the country. Satellite broadcasts, coupled with the use of an audio conferencing system at each receive site, provide another effective method for interactive course delivery to sites beyond the university campus. During the three years in which technical Japanese courses have been delivered via audiographics or satellite to remote sites, student acceptance of the computer-based instructional system has been excellent. In this paper we describe the impact of audiographic teleconferencing on the teaching of technical Japanese. In a future paper we will analyze the performance of students on and off campus. © 1994 IEEE.},

A software prototype based on Item Response Theory has been developed and is described here. This application was designed to estimate the level of proficiency in English for those students whose first language is not English. Academic staff and students evaluated the prototype introduced here and we summarise their attitude to the user interface and to pedagogical aspects of the prototype. We provide evidence that learners are not disadvantaged by the CAT approach, based on a comparison of performance between CAT and computer-based tests. A group of international students also took part in a focus group session after using the software. During this session, students discussed issues related to computer-adaptive tests, ranging from their perception that very easy tests are "meaningless" to their insights into the fairness of such computer-assisted assessments. In addition, this paper outlines how our current work will be developed further by implementing multimedia resources, developing more subjective tests and adding a stop condition associated with the calculation of standard error. Finally, the benefits and potential limitations of this method of assessment are also presented here. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The research included developing and testing a new training procedure for presentation of English to Spanish and Spanish to English word pairs. The experiments demonstrated that number of word pairs used per lesson (5, 10, or 15 pairs) did not influence how much was learned when lessons were repeated on 3 consecutive days. Constant as opposed to varied orders of pair presentation did not affect the rate at which pairs were learned. Tests with feedback on word pairs 5 and 15 days after training prevented an increase in errors 25 days after training. Repeating lessons on 3 consecutive days as opposed to just 1 day led to fewer errors during tests that occurred 5 or 15 days after training. It did not matter if Spanish to English pairs were presented before or after English to Spanish pairs during a daily training session. In addition, intermixing Spanish to English and English to Spanish pairs did not lead to better performance as compared to presenting English to Spanish or Spanish to English pairs first. The present experiments show how a software developer can be used as the subject in a series of experiments to determine parameters for an educational computer program. © 1994.},

	abstract = {Communication on the Internet offers teachers a unique method for promoting learning among students who are challenged by numerous factors such as linguistic and cultural considerations. This article describes the use of out-of-class online discussions to promote active student learning among a diverse group of baccalaureate nursing students enrolled in a large lecture class. Student-to-student and teacher-to-student asynchronous threaded discussions occurred out of class. Students earned class points by posting and responding to classroom topics. By the end of the 15-week semester, there were approximately 790 messages on the bulletin board. Eighty-five percent of the 64 students participated in this assignment. Of the 64 students, approximately 50% were moderate to high users of the activity and 14% did not participate at all. There were no statistical differences between native English-speaking and non-native English-speaking students and their preference for study partners, interest, or experience with the Internet. These initial results suggest that this assignment, based on electronic discussions, promoted greater participation and feedback among this diverse nursing student population. Despite the potential isolation of Internet and e-mail-based communications, this computer-based technology may, ironically, facilitate an important shift from teacher-orchestrated to student-centered learning.

	abstract = {A cultural gap is widening in English secondary schools: between a twentieth-century ethos of institutional provision and the twenty-first century expectations and digital lifestyles of school students. Perhaps disaffected by traditional teaching methods and the competitive target culture of schools, many students have turned to social networking through the cluster of computer-based applications known as Web 2.0. Here, they can communicate, share and learn informally using knowledge systems their elders can barely understand. Some of their contemporaries have turned away altogether, rejecting school and contributing to record levels of truancy and exclusion. This paper identifies a set of challenges for school leaders in relation to the growing digital/cultural gap. The government agenda for personalised learning is discussed, alongside strategies which schools might adopt to support this through the use of ICT, and both figure in scenario projections which envision how secondary education could change in the future. The paper concludes by recommending three priorities for school leaders.},

	abstract = {BIOSIM is a biologically oriented neural network simulator, which is available as public domain software. BIOSIM was designed for research and teaching. Hence, the ease of handling was of prime importance. This task was achieved by implementing a graphical user interface and presenting it as a turnkey system which avoids the necessity to learn complex programming languages. In BIOSIM, four neuron models are implemented: a simple model only switching ion channels on and off, the original Hodgkin-Huxley model, the SWIM model (a modified HH model) and the Golowasch-Buchholz model as the most enhanced model. Dendrites consist of a chain of segments without bifurcation. Three synaptic types are predefined (excitatory, inhibitory and electrical). Additional synaptic types can be created interactively. Biologically oriented learning and forgetting processes are modeled, e.g. sensitization, habituation, conditioning, hebbian learning and competition learning. A neural network can be created by using the interactive network editor which is part of BIOSIM. Parameters can be changed via context sensitive menus and the results of the simulation can be visualized in observation windows for neurons and synapses. Stochastic processes such as noise can be included. A demonstration shell script, which controls the simulator, is included showing a wide range of possibilities with BIOSIM. A hypertext based online-help system is embedded. BIOSIM was designed as a bilingual (English and German) system, which can easily be augmented by other languages.; A biologically oriented network simulator designed primarily for research and teaching, BIOSIM features an interactive graphical interface which is presented as a turnkey system to avoid the necessity to learn complex programming languages. This type of representation ensures ease of handling the simulator.

	abstract = {Interest in games (online and mobile) is expanding geographically and demographically. Statistics from the US Entertainment Software Association suggest that there are now more women players in the US than there are teenage gamers. Online gaming was up 40% in 2005 from 2004 and is growing about 22% a year and is expected to post $24 billion in revenues by 2010. Online gaming represents a merger of two successful and profitable industries - entertainment (gaming) and telecommunications. By 2009, mobile gaming services in the US are expected to generate $1.8 billion annually, or approximately 4.4% of total wireless data revenues. Additionally, by 2009, 78.6 million wireless subscribers in the US will play mobile games, and gaming downloads will increase more than tenfold from 2003 levels. Women now make up 43 percent of the $7.3 billion video/software game market, according to the Entertainment Software Association. Several surveys have found that genders are nearly evenly balanced, with males accounting for a slightly larger portion (53 percent). With the explosion of women gamers, there needs to be a sea-change in the industry, with more female developers and more games for women. A study (NPD group) found that two-thirds 13 to 44-year-olds are using their PC or Mac instead of consoles. It concludes that online gamers spent more time playing PC games online than offline (60 percent compared to 40 percent), while the opposite was true for connected console gamers. A recent study by Nielsen's NetRatings finds that males accounted for 51 percent of the 46 million online gamers. Business-wise online gaming promises to do well due to the following reasons: (i) Gaming is profitable and an advertiser's dream come true, (ii) Gaming is fun and addictive, (iii) Games drives the need for better hardware and software (iv) Technology for gaming can spur rapid digital evolution, (v) Easier access to broadband changes how people get and play games and hence broadband providers will embrace gamers' needs. Currently there are several types of online games. These include: Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG), Role Playing Games (RPGs), First Person Shooters (FPSs), Real-Time Strategy Games (RTSGs), Turn-Based Strategy Games (TBSGs), Racing and Flying Games (RaFGs), Action/Adventure (A/A). While MMORPGs are more male-dominated, an AOL/Time Warner poll indicates that women tend to favor word, board, card and puzzle games; shying away from violent, complex, time-consuming, and expensive games. Women are more interested in games with communication and interaction and constructively putting things together when they play online. Online games also helps women feel empowered, builds confidence and a much stronger sense of self. Multi-player games may also appeal more than single-player ones since many studies have shown that women enjoy games that focus on building social networks and support structures, as evidenced by their preference for socially-focused virtual worlds like There (www.there.com) and Second Life (www.secondlife.com). The social component is vital for many women, for example, There enables a richer social interaction by employing facial and body gestures in addition to text (and voice) conversation. Even in MMORPGs one may be able to attract more women by managing the depth of the storyline and character. For example it has been reported that Prince of Persia appeals to both men and women. In addition women seem to like games that are easy to pick up, play, and master, rather than those with complicated controls that require a lot of time to learn. Charlotte Stuyvenberg, director of global communications for Xbox says that women gamers are very social, very strategic and they like to work together to solve problems. Noticing this significant trend towards how the field of Computer Science was evolving, since the 2006 Fall semester, we have begun a 'parallel' option (titled GAME: Graphics, Animation, Multimedia and Entertainment) in the entry level classes where games are used as examples and development exercises to inculcate basic computing concepts such as lists, arrays, queues and other simple data structures. Further more we have collaborated with the English Composition teachers to develop special sections that cater to students in this option, where students learn techniques such as storyboarding, etc. Students also receive a minor in Digital Imaging from the Art department. Other coursework in Criminal Justice and Radio, Television and Film were added as appropriate substitutes to provide the students a 'holistic' experience to various issues involved with the gaming and entertainment industry. This evolution of our curriculum has been a very popular option that has stemmed the tide against declining student interest with significant improvements in our enrollment numbers. Further more, some advanced courses in Computer Science such as AI, HCI and Modeling and Simulation have also been successfully integrated into the GAME curriculum. In the Modeling and Simulation Course, students were introduced to the pervasive effect of modeling and simulation in the real world by developing an automated traffic signal monitoring and control system. Furthermore, in a capstone project students were engaged to use SecondLife to develop an integrated student / alumni / stakeholder survey system. In this presentation I will summarize the above progress that has been made in revamping our Computing Curricula by refocusing on using Gaming, Simulation and Visualization to impart basic and advanced computing concepts to students. © 2009 Copyright held by author/owner.},

Since the mid-1990s, South African education has moved from a dual system favouring one privileged class, to one that embraces integration and equality. This move has been complex and fraught with the difficulties inherent in incorporating disadvantaged pupils from multilingual backgrounds into previously-'advantaged' classrooms with English as the principle medium of tuition. In order to cope with widely-varying student needs, an interactive computer-based application has been created to enable students to diagnose their own specific weaknesses and to provide personalised assistance in overcoming them. Results demonstrate that the system is highly effective in improving students' performance, establishing a closer sense of personal attention, and in alleviating the pedagogical stresses experienced by instructors in an extremely demanding educational environment. © 2002 IEEE.},

This system, so designed to enhance interactivity between the computer and the learner, can automatically generate a context-sensitive hint for an error by tracking the mouse movement of the learner. Also in a problem with many unknown words in it, it can automatically produce a relevant hint according to the context and the learner's vocabulary. Our experiments showed that the learner was able to get the sense of achievement by utilizing the hints generated by the system rather than by being given the answer directly. The system does not provide the answer, but makes the learners think for themselves. Through the experiments, we also found such hints as location information were very efficient in building a dialogical relationship between the computer and the learner, simulating the actual situation where the instructor teaches in the classroom. Hearing instructions from the computer gives them opportunities to hear various sentences in English, and develop their recognition circuit of English in a direct way.},

	abstract = {The generally accepted wisdom among teachers of English composition is that a "rewrite cycle" should be used as a teaching strategy. Rather than expecting students to extrapolate from the grading comments on paper N what they should do differently on paper N + 1, it has become conventional to ask for a rewrite of paper N itself. Of course, there are many variations on this theme. For example, peer review may supplement or replace some of the rounds of grading. The panelists will explore some of the ways they have applied this pedagogic strategy in computer science courses. Most obviously, when we have our students write papers, we have them do rewrites. However, some of us don't stop there, but rather also apply the same idea to the writing of programs or mathematical analyses. This encourages our students to do a high-quality job, and to feel that they have truly mastered a topic. Clearly, there are tradeoffs and difficulties, principally involving time. The panelists will also discuss this aspect, indicating how they have coped with the pitfalls, and indicating what has worked well, and what not so well Ultimately, however, all the panelists are optimistic about the value of rewrite cycles. After the panelists share their experiences, there will be some time for discussion with the audience. Based on the interest this topic provoked on the sigcse.members mailing list, and in ensuing private email, we look forward to an active audience. We will also make materials from the session available at http://www.gustavus.edu/~max/rewrite/.},

We have built and tested an English composition critiquing system that makes use of LSA to analyze student essays and compute feedback by comparing their essays with teacher's model essays. LSA values are input to a critiquing component to provide a user interface for the students. A software agent can also use the critic feedback to coordinate a collaborative knowledge-building session with multiple users (students and teachers). Shared feedback provides seed questions that can trigger discussion and extended reflection about the next phase of writing. We present the first version of a prototype we have built and report the results from three experiments. We end the paper by describing our plans for future work. Copyright © 2007, Idea Group Inc.},

The first group of experiments compared UML to natural languages (e.g. English); the second group modeled the entire software development process as a sequence of translations from more abstract languages to more formal languages (e.g. from English to UML, from UML to C++, etc.). In these experiments the authors and their students discovered new approaches to increasing productivity of software developers. On this basis, the authors have developed the framework that extends traditional development processes. The framework is built upon two simple, yet powerful principles: Reverse Semantic Traceability (RST) and Speechless Modeling. The authors have over two years of experience of using RST in computing curricula, and also have over six years of experience of applying Speechless Modeling in teaching computer science and software engineering. Both approaches resulted in improving the quality of education and generated positive feedback from students. Some students started to practice the authors' framework in their professional careers. In this paper, the authors present their experience of integrating RST and Speechless Modeling into university computer science/software engineering curricula. © 2007 IEEE.},

Some students, as novice software designers, possess obstacles that impede the problem solving process and often lead to an inability to solve problems correctly. Students are not proficient in identifying abstractions at different levels as required by distributed systems. The process of generalization by reducing the information content of a concept or of an observable phenomenon is hard to master for novices, who rely on surface features. Implementations of poorly designed distributed processes can exhibit a bizarre behavior. We use an inductive learning approach using several classroom assessment techniques (CAT) to assess how well students are learning. The learning approach is a spiral approach based on reflection and knowledge collaboration for problem resolution. We introduce each level of abstraction with concrete, practical examples of a case-study, relating the abstract concept to students' concrete experiences. The techniques of argumentative essay writing recommended for undergraduates in Liberal Studies and English courses and the CATs for "Assessing skill in problem solving" ("Problem Recognition Tasks", "What's the Principle" and "Documented Problem Solutions") are used for the reflection on the concepts. © 2009 IEEE.},

It reports on a collaborative programme of small-scale projects undertaken by 15 teacher-researchers using various forms of computer-based ICT to support subject teaching and learning. The participants developed, trialled and refined new pedagogic approaches and activities in six curriculum areas (English, classics, design technology, geography, history, science) at secondary level. A cross-case analysis was conducted using lesson observations, follow-up teacher interviews and teachers' research reports. A typology of proactive and responsive pedagogic strategies for mediating pupil interactions with ICT was identified. These included exploiting the technology in new ways and circumventing its associated constraints. The strategies emerging illustrated how teachers structured activities judiciously; supported, guided and challenged; encouraged pupil collaboration, experimentation, reflection and analysis; avoided floundering and maintained a focus on subject learning; integrated the use of other resources; and developed information handling skills. These strategies and the gradual withdrawal of teacher support served to increase pupil participation and responsibility for their own learning. Pupils themselves played a role in structuring TICs through opportunistically soliciting teacher assistance and feedback. © 2005, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a computer-based, auditory-visual vowel identification training program on sentence recognition under difficult listening conditions. Method: Normal-hearing adults were trained and tested under auditory-visual conditions, in noise designed to simulate the effects of a hearing loss. After initial tests of vowel, word, and sentence recognition, 1 group of participants received training on identification of 10 American English vowels in CVC context. Another group of participants received no training. All participants were then retested on vowel, word, and sentence recognition. Results: Improvements were seen for trained compared with untrained participants, in auditory-visual speech recognition under difficult listening conditions, for vowels in monosyllables and key words in sentences. Conclusions: Results from this study suggest benefit may be gained from this computer-based, auditory-visual vowel identification training method. © American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.},

However, it remains an open question whether these benefits will extend to other domains like second language grammar learning. Within the domain of the English article system (teaching students when to use a, an, the, or no article at all), we compare two computer-based tutoring conditions in an in vivo classroom study. In the article choice condition, students select the correct article to complete the sentence. In the explanation choice condition, students are given a sentence with the correct article highlighted and choose the rule or feature that best explains the article use. Students (N=101) in both conditions show significant learning on both procedural (article choice) and declarative (explanation choice) tasks. Not surprisingly, we found that declarative instruction (explanation choice) led to significant learning of explanations, while procedural practice (article choice) led to significant learning of the procedures. More interestingly, we also found evidence of cross-type transfer such that declarative practice led to procedural gains and procedural practice led to better understanding of the declarative rules. In general the effects of prompted self-explanation appeared somewhat stronger than those of procedural practice.},

Within- and cross-case analyses drew on multiple sources of data and characterised teachers' initial statements of practical theory in terms of five key themes: broadening classroom resources and reference; enhancing working processes and products; fostering more independent pupil activity; mediating subject thinking and learning; and improving pupil motivation towards lessons. Three cases are presented to illustrate how teachers developed their ideas in action, and issues that prompted teachers across cases to adapt their approaches are discussed.},

	abstract = {In this research we describe the development of a modular Teaching Head platform for research into the linguistic and social aspects of effective communication with and by an Artificial Intelligence. A number of embedding scenarios will be discussed, focusing in particular on the embedding combination of the Thinking Head, a simulated Robot World, and a monitored Real World stage, in the context of game-like and puzzle-like teaching scenarios. The Thinking Head platform consists very simply of a perceptual/sensory input stage, a mid-brain or dialogue manager, and an effectual/motor output stage. The input may be text or speech, and the output is audio-visual synchronized speech. This simple chain is designed to allow straightforward substitution of modules, or expansion to provide additional multimodality. The Microjaea and Magrathea Robot Worlds were designed as platforms for language and ontology learning. The environment allows simple real world scenarios to be simulated with unlimited variations. Originally it was designed and used to teach computers language using simulated grounding of semantics, but now we are adapting it to allow the computer to demonstrate it's understanding of a concept or in fact to teach a concept or language, to a human participant. The composite Teaching Head platform includes a number of cameras and microphones - these not only handle speech recognition, but allow lip-reading, expression-reading, speaker identification and tracking, and object identification and tracking. Conversely, the AV output not only shows a correctly articulating face synchronized with the speech, but allows expressions appropriate to the content, or on demand, to be interspersed or overlaid. Currently the application we focus on is the teaching of German as a second language - dwelling particularly on aspects that are difficult for English-background speakers. A major issue in this research is developing a system that is capable of capturing and holding the attention of learners from preschool age through to adult. One aspect in this is that learners at no time see a computer or feel they are interacting with a computer - rather they interact with toys in the physical world, while the computer is presented as a teacher's head and interacts with a duplicate set of props in the simulated world. A second aspect is that teaching scenarios are being developed that are targeted to different age groups, and are also targetable independently to different language abilities and background knowledge levels - for example pre-school children of German-speaking parents living in an English-speaking country are likely to have considerably more vocabulary and language knowledge of German than students of German commencing their exposure to the language as adults. In this paper, we present our designs for game-like scenarios that are influenced by popular games and puzzles, electronic and traditional, that draw on the experience of web-sites and multimedia tools for language teaching, and that provide challenges and opportunities that are rich enough to encourage ongoing use of the tool, whether in the native language or the target language. We do so expressly seeking feedback from the gaming community, and also inviting active collaboration in the project.},

Further study was conducted to identify positive and negative factors influencing the effectiveness of CALL system on listening comprehension. The factors considered in this study were the teaching style, the time available for the students to study, help options and student's motivation. After a period of two-yearresearch and test, the corresponding data analyses and results of this study confirmed the influence of the above factors on the effectiveness and usefulness of CALL system. In addition, it was concluded that no one factor alone, could optimize the effect of listening comprehension, and that a systems approach is indispensable in improving the efficacy of listening comprehension by CALL. ©2009 IEEE.},

It focuses on the systems of ideas which frame teacher accounts of the successful use of computer-based tools and resources in the core subjects of English, Mathematics and Science at secondary-school level. These accounts were elicited through group interviews with the relevant subject departments in six secondary schools in England. The analysis identifies seven broad themes in which teachers point to the contribution of technology use in: effecting working processes and improving production; supporting processes of checking, trialling and refinement; enhancing the variety and appeal of classroom activity; fostering pupil independence and peer support; overcoming pupil difficulties and building assurance; broadening reference and increasing currency of activity; and focusing on overarching issues and accentuating important features. Further examination of these themes shows how professional thinking about technology use is anchored in well-established representations of pupil motivation and classroom learning, and how contrasting subject profiles reflect corresponding differences in wider subject cultures. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The system combines a microcomputer with an optional laserdisc player, however the system is not dependent upon the use of a laserdisc player. Students interact by means of the keyboard using natural English Input. In the area of history the dialogue resembles that which might occur with a live patient. All students enquiries and screen displays are recorded in order to later assess performance. These simulations have been used successfully for the last four years to enhance students' clinical problem-solving skills in an Integrative Course. MAPS was designed to be independent of the content area and the shell can be used in any educational/training area in which hypotheses are generated and refined through data collection and interpretation. © 1987 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.},

Considering the shortcomings for the current teaching-learning methodology, we have been investigating advanced computer-assisted language learning (CALL) systems. This paper aims at summarizing a set of POSTECH approaches including theories, technologies, systems, and field studies. On top of the state-of-the-art technologies of spoken dialog system, a variety of adaptations have been applied to overcome some problems caused by numerous errors and variations naturally produced by non-native speakers. Furthermore, a number of methods have been developed for generating educational feedback and mining educational data from Internet. Integrating these efforts resulted in intelligent educational robots - Mero and Engkey - and virtual 3D language learning games, Pomy. To verify the effects of our approaches on students' communicative abilities, we have conducted a field study at an elementary school in Korea. The results showed that our CALL approaches can be enjoyable and fruitful activities for students. Although the results of this study bring us a step closer to understanding computer-based education, more studies are needed to consolidate the findings.},

Strategies for effective hybrid implementation of Learning Management Systems in L2 tertiary education include computer-based Internet-hosted L2 aptitude tests.

	abstract = {In this paper we shall discuss the potential of serious games for teaching and learning languages online. As suggested by for instance Warschauer (2004) computer-assisted language learning (CALL) may have a profound influence on the ways in which languages are learned and taught, as CALL may support the need of language learners to use languages in meaningful contexts to have a real impact on the world. The issue for language education may therefore be to explore the potential of online games for simulated or real interaction that includes learners' own production of language in protected settings. The paper will build on data from a research project, Serious Games on a Global Market Place (2007- 2010), funded by the Danish Council for Strategic Research, in which an online game-based platform for teaching and learning English (www.Mingoville.com) has been studied in the context of English as a second language in Danish primary schools. The initial research process - which was based on an analysis of the platform as well as interviews with developers - suggested that one of the challenges of developing a design for serious games in language education consists of renegotiating the educational games genre to balance drill-based exercises with contextualised simulations that involve fruitful thinking, real language interaction and student engagement. One hypothesis of the project is, following the initial research and drawing on previous research in the field, that the process of designing serious games for CALL may significantly benefit from involving children's own experiences with using languages (primarily English) online for gaming and interacting. The paper will suggest ways of incorporating these experiences into the educational design of game-based material for CALL.},

	abstract = {The aim of this project is teach all humans at any time anywhere by using HCI (Human Computer Interaction) principles and educational physiologies' concepts. All standards and principles of the HCI and Educational physiologies are used in the project. Learning goals of the paper is to give experiences to users about their courses and teaches. Project allows that secure system using and ergonomic field study in advanced and beginner types of interface. It can be applied to all courses e.g. C programming language, English Language for Child e.t.c. the idea comes from international field studies transforming face-to face higher-education courses to Computer based teaching delivery. Central to the research value is the 'how' adult learning, instruction, organizational science and systems theories are integrated for the benefit of organization, student, professor to support efficient and effective e-teaching technology, informed by adult learning goal theory. Contemporary theoretical views of course design and delivery can be articulated within frameworks originating in educational psychology and other social science fields. E-Learning is term covering a wide set of applications and processes, such as Web-Base learning, Computer-Base Learning, virtual Classrooms and digital collaboration. This study aim is about" how to teach the adult learners using Technological Environment and E-Learning object principles". The project includes a system to manage and teach the student with Computer-Based Application (CBA). This paper includes how to create the e-learning system. The paper consists of learning principles (e.g. Motivation, Cognition, and Efficacy) for both designing and teaching. The application of systems methodologies to structure content and delivery (e.g. programmed instruction, test-banks, and examinations), applying instructional techniques (met cognitive learning-to-learn approaches), and by leveraging computer systems (relational database design, teaching with object oriented technology) for effective and efficient desktop application adult course design and delivery © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.},

	abstract = {One of the skills that can be taught in an English proficiency class that adopts literary texts for teaching the language is critical thinking. The background, characters and their motives are among those that invite critical inquiry and interpretation. Although it has been claimed that discussing literary texts in the traditional way can help develop students' critical thinking skills, it is yet to be proved whether the use of a teaching aid can help the process. This study is, therefore, carried out to see if the use of computer software can help to develop such skills. It specifically looks at the potential of a literary text, Othello, and a concordancer in developing and enhancing critical thinking abilities of 40 English as a Second Language (ESL) students at the International Islamic University Malaysia. An experimental study was carried out, where an experimental group was exposed to text analysis using a concordancer whilst the control group analysed the text manually. The Cornell Critical Thinking Test was used to analyse the critical thinking ability of the students. The experimental group outperformed the control group in all the subscales measured, but the percentage of variance in the scores was low.},

The essence of this training involves giving an assignment to create a high-level design for a software system to a team of students. They are required to use UML and are not allowed to use any other language (English, German, Russian, Ukrainian, etc), either spoken or written. Students are given 4-6 hours to complete the task. This assignment is always presented as an experiment - the students are to discover whether or not UML is "a real language" that can successfully serve as a communication tool within a team. The authors call this training "The Babel Experiment". This training allows students to work through typical problems of software development projects and to see how UML helps solve these problems. This training was developed by Vladimir L. Pavlov in 2001 and it has been successfully conducted at universities and software companies over ten times. In universities, this training has been used as a kind of capstone project for traditional OOA/OOD/UML courses; however, for software companies this training was mostly delivered as a stand-alone course. In all cases this training course has received very positive feedback from students and customers.},

	abstract = {Technological advances have revolutionised methods of both teaching and testing in languages, and practitioners have eagerly embraced the opportunity to provide more innovative ways of doing this. The unique features offered by technology make it increasingly possible to test for a wide range of language skills required for a specific purpose. With the increasing need to test for English language proficiency and the importance placed on this facility, technology is being utilised to address issues of practicality, speed and efficiency. However, such advantages should not be embraced without due consideration for the essential qualities of any test; validity and reliability. With the inevitable shift towards computer-based testing, certain areas need special consideration. While computer-based tests can provide constructive diagnostic information to complement the language learning process, they should be used more selectively in other contexts, for example in high-stakes tests, examples of which are International English Language Testing System (IELTS) and Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). These tests provide an assessment of English language proficiency, a key component of university admissions criteria. This paper examines a number of issues related to the design and application of computer-based tests, with particular reference to construct validity, computer familiarity and practicality. It is recommended that in the short term at least, test-takers be offered the choice of test medium in the interests of fairness and equity. © 2008, European Association for Computer Assisted Language Learning.
