	abstract = {During the joining of two metal sheets by welding, a process-specific geometry of the weld is created. The local geometry of the created weld has a decisive influence on its fatigue strength. This is due to stress concentration at the geometric notches. In this paper, a process known from mechanical engineering called deep rolling is applied on butt welds. The influence on the local weld geometry and the local stress concentration after deep rolling is investigated. Additionally, a novel automated measurement system using optical laser line scanning is presented. The system is qualified for the evaluation of the local weld geometry regarding its flank angles and toe radii. The presented investigations show that the deep rolling process influences the stress concentrations determined by 2D-FE-simulations using real scan data. A correlation between the difference in toe radii or local notch stresses before and after deep rolling and the initial flank angle was found. This indicates that there are process and geometry specific conditions for the successful application of the deep rolling process. © 2022, The Author(s).},

A matrix is used to check and assess the students on desired objectives to determine their learning outcomes. This project required robustness and efficiency improvements of an existing robotic work cell. This new robotic work cell incorporates an automatic clamping, drilling/reaming, and inspection stations as well as a new material handling feeding system. The equipment used in this project includes a Kawasaki RS005L robotic arm, sensors, pneumatics, and a Cognex 7801 Vision System. For this research, wooden blocks of similar size are loaded onto an in-feed pallet by an operator that is transported using an air bearing and a cylinder. The parts will then be depalletized by a robot and placed into a hopper via cylinders. These blocks will then be fed into the drilling/reaming operation and clamped one-by-one. The blocks will be drilled through and reamed before it is then transported by the robotic arm to the vision system. The vision system will determine if the hole is acceptable. The parts will then be loaded onto a finished pallet if they pass the inspection. Copyright © 2022 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Design automation in mechanical engineering requires students not only to obtain competences in the application of computer aided design software and the creation of knowledge-based product models. Future knowledge engineers need e.g., communicational skills in order to acquire the relevant knowledge for later implementation in design automation systems, or skills for planning, modelling, and exploring a design solution space. In a flipped classroom setup, where the responsibility for the learning process and thus several degrees of freedom regarding topics and their weighting are transferred to the students, a later summative assessment needs to fulfil two basic requirements: First to reflect the individual learning progress of a student, second to discover if the higher learning goals of the course are met. Constructive alignment is a technique to relate teaching activities, learning outcomes and assessment to each other and to the competences that a learner should acquire. The present paper reports about the assessment for a flipped classroom design automation lecture. Starting from the educational objectives and the learning activities, two different assessment mechanisms are characterized: A semester project where two or three students works as a team of knowledge engineers to create a knowledge-based engineering system, e.g., a product configurator, and an oral exam where each student has the opportunity to report about his or her individual learning process and dispute this with the teaching staff. © PDE 2021.},

In the meantime, there exists a strong need for more understanding of dynamic flexoelectric electromechanical response in application areas such as energy harvester, wave filter and so on. However, benefitting from the external equation interface of COMSOL Multiphysics, we developed a cost-effective numerical approach to implement the dynamic flexoelectric electromechanical response in dielectric solids. As a specific case, a plate-mass-type energy harvester employing a perovskite ceramic material is studied and the corresponding output voltages, electric power and natural frequencies are analyzed in different conditions.  © 2021 IEEE.},

In Slovakia, Industry 4.0 plays an important role, especially in the mechanical engineering industry (MEI). This paper aims to identify the groups of financial ratios that can be used to measure the financial performance of the companies operating in the Slovak MEI. From the whole MEI, we selected the 236 largest non-financial corporations whose ranking we obtained according to the amount of generated revenues in 2017. Using factor analysis, from eleven traditional financial ratios, we extracted four independent factors that measure liquidity (equity to liabilities ratio, quick ratio, debt ratio, net working capital to assets ratio, current ratio), profitability (return on sales, return on investments), indebtedness (financial leverage, debt to equity ratio), and activity (assets turnover, current assets turnover) of the company. Our analysis is an essential prerequisite for developing a realistic financial plan for companies operating in the MEI, especially when considering investments in new technologies related to Industry 4.0. © 2021 by the authors.

With the wide application of robot technology, obstacle avoidance motion planning of manipulator has become one of the hot issues in the field of robot research. This paper presents the research on the obstacle avoidance motion planning of a 6-DOF serial manipulator in a static space environment. This Obstacle avoidance motion planning is carried out by using the method of configuration space motion planning. Firstly, the obstacle avoidance problem is described mathematically, and a new collision detection method based on a capsule model envelope is proposed. Then RRT algorithm is improved from sampling space and sampling strategy to generate a collision-free motion path from the initial position to target position. The simulation experiment of the multi-obstacle working environment in MATLAB® verifies the feasibility of the improved algorithm. This study shows that the motion planning method of the improved RRT algorithm is not only feasible in theory, but also can meet the needs of practical application and ensure that there is no collision between the manipulator and the obstacles. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {To apply self-piercing riveted (SPR) connections with high efficiency and a high degree of automation in the field of mechanical engineering to cold-formed thin-wall steel structures, the shear behavior of 51 groups of SPR connections on thin-walled steel sheets were tested. The influences of the steel sheet thickness, thickness ratio and rivet length on the shear behavior and failure mechanism of the SPR connections were studied. An empirical formula that combines the steel sheet thickness and rivet length was fitted. We also analyzed the feasibility for the existing calculation method of the shear strength of SPR connections and design methods of the shear capacity of self-tapping screw connections in the specifications of five countries. Based on the results of the test and the analysis, a calculation method of calculating the shear capacity was proposed. The result showed that the steel sheet thickness and thickness ratio had the most significant effect on the shear behavior and failure mechanism, respectively. The rivet length had a great influence on the shear properties and an optimal length could be determined quickly by the fitted empirical formula. Compared with the existing methods, the calculation method proposed for different failure modes was more suitable for the design because of higher accuracy and better stability. © 2020, Engineering Mechanics Press.

	abstract = {Automated post weld treatment for offshore wind turbines. A more economical and resource-saving construction of offshore wind energy converters (OWEC) is necessary in order to implement climate policy objectives. The increase of the fatigue resistance by using high-strength steels and by applying post-weld treatment methods offers great potential for reducing the use of materials and costs for monopiles. Specifically, in the automated OWEC manufacturing chain, automated processes such as deep rolling are a suitable option. Deep rolling is an established process in mechanical engineering for increasing the wear and fatigue resistance of metallic components. This paper presents results of deep rolling as a new post treatment method to increase the fatigue strength of welds. The surface and subsurface zone properties of submerged arc welded butt joints made of a structural steel grade S355MLO before and after deep rolling are shown. In order to quantify the influence of deep rolling on the weld geometry, measurements of a laser line sensor are presented. Finally, the results of fatigue tests are discussed, which show the great potential of the deep rolling process as a post weld treatment method. © 2022, Ernst und Sohn. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This work-in-progress paper presents some preliminary data from a study investigating the effect of assessment frequency on students' long-term retention of engineering course content. In this study, a variety of hypotheses designed to identify the factors that impact students' long-term retention of course content are tested. However, the primary hypothesis can be stated as follows: higher frequencies of assessment lead to improved long-term retention of course content. This hypothesis is investigated by implementing a different assessment frequency in two sections of the same course. In one section, students are given two midterms spaced roughly four weeks apart, while in the second section, students are given a twenty-five minute quiz roughly every two weeks. The students' long-term retention is then measured by their performance on the final exam, which is common to both sections. This study is conducted across three different core courses in the mechanical engineering curriculum; Principles of Thermodynamics II, Mechanics of Materials II, and Automatic Control Systems. The results from Thermodynamics II and Automatic Controls showed no statistically significant difference in student performance between the two assessment frequencies, while in Mechanics of Materials II, the section that was assessed more frequently performed significantly better on the final exam. However, the low sample sizes in each section decrease the statistical power of the study, making it challenging to arrive at meaningful conclusions. However, the lessons learned from this study are being used to construct a study in the thermodynamics sequence, which will be conducted over multiple years to collate a sufficiently large sample size which will increase the power of the study. Furthermore, this study will seek to lengthen the time-scale over which student retention is being measured. In other words, in this study "long-term" is associated with the students' ability to retain content over the course of a 10-week quarter, while in the future study, students' content retention will be tracked over multiple terms over a complete sequence of courses. This will provide a more meaningful indicator of long-term content retention. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.},

	abstract = {The US Department of Labor projects an increase in the number of engineers in the USA from 1.68 million to 1.82 million by 2026. The fastest-growing demands are in Data Science and Machine Learning, and Mechatronics and Robotics. The term ‘Mechatronics’ is expanding its horizon due to the current digital disruptions in industrial automation. Starting with a concept of leveraging the synergy between mechanical and electrical engineering from a system theoretic prospect, mechatronics now encompasses several engineering disciplines, including intelligent control, wireless networking, the Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical systems, and autonomous vehicles. Mechatronics finds its application in almost every engineering field, such as cyber-based smart manufacturing, medical, agricultural and bio-systems, autonomous vehicles. Robotics is another engineering discipline, often connected with mechatronics, revolutionizing industrial automation and other applications. The fields of robotics and mechatronics are tightly integrated, and robotics can be considered one of mechatronics’application areas. With the rapid technological explosion, the demand for the interdisciplinary workforce has been increased significantly. This demand calls for developing a trained workforce, and universities and colleges have started offering new curricula in mechatronics and robotics. In general, the focus of these programs depends on the faculty research areas and local industrial demands. From the perspective of Engineering Technology, where hands-on learning is pervasive, the Mechatronics and Robotics curriculum development is of more importance to cope with the  industry-ready workforce demand. However, there are several challenges involved in developing and implementing such a program, especially at the graduate level, due to students’ expected diverse backgrounds. The Division of Engineering Technology at the Oklahoma State University recently developed a Master of Engineering Technology (MSET) degree program with the Mechatronics and Robotics (MERO) option. The curriculum leverages the Electrical Engineering Technology and Mechanical Engineering Technology faculty’s expertise and has multiple focus areas, such as control, artificial intelligence, additive manufacturing, autonomous vehicle, electrohydraulics, energy, and vibration. The paper presents the curriculum developmental process, industry feedback, and the challenges involved during the process in detail from the engineering technology perspective. It also includes discussion on the two different tracks for earning the MSET degree with a flexible selection for the research focus area. This paper will add value to the technology programs planning to develop a new MERO curriculum in the future. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021},

	abstract = {Humanity is at a unique point in history where what was once believed to be science fiction is now shifting to become the real, emerging technology of today. Tantamount to this development of new technologies is the convergence of previously dichotomous disciplines including computer science, cellular biology, molecular biology, mechanical engineering, and technical disciplines. At the intersection of biotechnology and technology are emerging biosecurity considerations worth exploring in the context of innovation, biological design, manufacturing, automation, and artificial intelligence. There are also biosecurity considerations related to individuals and new skill sets developing as a result of technological and biotechnological progress. This chapter explores the various intersections of the world’s most advanced technologies and outlines a model for the “full stack biotechnologist,” a multiskilled expert with myriad capabilities and new considerations for risk and threat potentials. As technology and innovation progress to new heights and capabilities, perhaps the magnum opus of silicone advancement dictated by Moore’s Law will be its impact on giving rise to its potential replacement: biotechnology. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {At present, insulator detection is mainly carried out by manual detection. Workers need to crawl to the height of the operation, and need a lot of auxiliary tools. Manual testing is inefficient, workers' safety can not be guaranteed, and the working process is cumbersome. Therefore, It is necessary to develop a portable and efficient automatic detection technology to detect insulators by using intelligent robots instead of human beings. Inspired by the working principle of the mechanical arm of CNSA Tianhe core cabin, a bionic crawling robot is proposed in this paper, which can crawl on the surface of the tension insulator to reach different parts of the insulator, improve the detection efficiency and ensure the safety of operators. Simulation and experiment show that the robot has a flexible movement mechanism and good automation, which can not only reduce the workers' missing and false detection, but also improve the detection efficiency. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The objective of this work was to better understand pedestrians' understanding, trust, comfort, and acceptance of autonomous vehicle (AV) external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs). A link between mechanical engineering (i.e., automotive engineering) and civil engineering (i.e., multimodal transportation systems) is necessary to understand the effectiveness of varying AV-to-human communication strategies. Using a within-subject experiment design, 47 participants interacted with AVs possessing one of four eHMIs in a virtual reality (VR) environment. We administered a Likert scale survey to measure participants' perceptions of the eHMIs and used ordinal logistic regressions to analyze the results. We also accounted for participants' gender and stated interest in AVs, novel contributions to this field of research. The presence of an eHMI was found to improve participants' perceptions of AVs. Although females generally reported higher levels of understanding, trust, comfort, and acceptance, males' scores increased more significantly with the introduction of an eHMI. Text eHMIs outperformed nontextual interfaces, with participants noting the best perceptions with the text eHMI located on the AV's grille. Participants' understanding and identification of right-of-way (ROW) were most improved by the eHMIs while trust and comfort were most impacted by the participants' stated interest in AVs. Acceptance had little response to the eHMIs or stated AV interest and gender had little impact in the statistical models. This research supports the development of a standard, uniform AV-pedestrian communication strategy and strengthens the connection between humans and AVs. © 2022 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

	abstract = {Instructors give homework to help students apply what they are learning in class. Grading the assignments is a time-consuming process for the instructor or teaching assistant, so the feedback to the student comes at a time when they are no longer thinking of the problem. In addition, many students obtain access to textbook solutions. Some book publishers (e.g., Pearson's Mastering Engineering and McGraw Hill's Connect) provide automated grading for homework problems. However, using a publisher's grading site is an additional expense for the students. To keep the benefits of automated grading, without the cost to the students, question pools in Blackboard were created for textbook problems but using different numbers. The same method was used for tests in some courses, allowing each student to have a different exam than other students in the class. Besides Blackboard problems, a grading program that automatically grades Excel files was used in one class to grade more complicated homework. Solving problems in Excel allowed problems involving significant calculations and graphs, such as a stress-strain curve to be computer-graded. At the end of the semester, the students completed a survey about their experiences with the automated grading systems. Students found the grading helpful and appreciated not having the extra expense of a textbook grading system. Setting up the problems was more effort in one semester than grading the work, but it will reduce the professor's workload in future semesters. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.},

	abstract = {Current challenges in engineering curriculum design, face the necessity of a multidisciplinary approach due to the increasing complexity of engineering problems. Students need to be exposed to a multidisciplinary environment and, on the other hand, it is necessary to ensure the teaching of all the fundamentals of each engineering within the respective curriculum. As an example, the contribution of automatic control to engineering has become a recognized pillar among the fundamental disciplines in engineering education. However, the instructors teaching control courses to students belonging to other engineering degrees than automation, must design a syllabus providing the right balance between fundamental theory and practical applications. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel approach consisting in the introduction of hands-on activities based on an Arduino engineering kit to teach control systems to mechanical engineering students. The novelty of this pilot study consists of bringing such a practical approach to the laboratory classes of robotics and mechatronics within the mechanical engineering curriculum involving also basic concepts of electronics and data acquisition and processign throught the interaction with sensors and actuators as well as programming skills to implement the control alogorithms on the Arduino device. This experience proved to be successful in helping students to maximize progress and build an effective comprehension of crucial engineering topics. It also showed that the hardware is appropriate to demonstrate and apply core learning principles. Moreover, it can be considered as a benchmark with potential effectiveness also in other courses and curricula. By realizing this approach, we envision that engineering education will be able to build important skills necessary to break down the walls between disciplines, enable cross-collaboration, produce well-rounded students, and increase employability opportunities. © 2020 SEFI 48th Annual Conference Engaging Engineering Education, Proceedings.

A feedback system has been developed for a CNC machine - coordinate measuring machine. This system allowed to reduce downtime of the DMG MORI CTX Beta 800 TC machine for periodic adjustments and to increase dimensional stability of processing. The measurements were carried out on a Mitutoyo KO-GA-ME CMM, after which the correction value was calculated and transmitted to the machine.

In detail, these are: 1) the additive covering of reinforcement meshes, which are hung in front of a printed core wall, 2) the lateral additive filling of a reinforcement cage and 3) the fully automatic construction of a reinforcement structure with immediate subsequent layer-by-layer encasing by extruded concrete. In addition to the current state of research and the material challenges, mechanical engineering development approaches and the calculative evaluation of the new processes in comparison to established construction methods will be presented. © 2022, Ernst und Sohn.

The ultimate purpose of this project is to manufacture and automate a transmission apparatus for the Machine Element Design Laboratory. The current team is the fourth team to work on this project and is tasked to build a better entry and exit shaft, as well as a braking system, and automate the entire system. The Willis Gearing Theory was used to determine the system's theoretical gear ratios. Next, the entry and exit shafts of the transmission, as well as the braking system, were designed using the SolidWorks CAD software. The blueprints were then sent out to a machine shop for manufacturing and then assembled. A programmable logic controller activated two linear actuators to move two keyed shafts at the entry and the exit of the transmission. An Arduino board was used to ensure safe placement of the braking blocks. It is expected that a future team will complete the PLC programming, measure the mechanical advantage of the system to compare to the theoretical velocity ratio, determine the efficiency of the transmission, and create a lab manual.

	abstract = {In order to solve the problems of low recognition accuracy and large memory occupied in the algorithm of pointer meter identification in substation, this paper proposes an improved algorithm of pointer meter automatic identification based on EAST algorithm, Tiny East. Firstly, the algorithm uses the lightweight neural network MOGA to replace the backbone network of East algorithm, thus reducing the memory occupied by the algorithm; Then, the feature pyramid is added to backbone network to strengthen the feature extraction. Besides, we use NMS local sensing algorithm to screen the reading box to get the scale number and position of the instrument. Thus, positioning the pointer line and the center of the instrument; Finally, the identification of the instrument is completed by combining the identified digital and pointer angles. Experimental results show that compared with the unimproved EAST algorithm, the number of parameters of the proposed TINY-EAST algorithm is greatly reduced, and the average recognition accuracy is higher than 98.5%. Moreover, the proposed TINY-EAST algorithm has good accuracy and stability in the complex background of pointer instrument and can meet the application requirements of practical substation. © 2021 IEEE.},

To design such systems, engineers need to be familiar with industrial motion controllers, bring together knowledge from kinematics, control theory, dynamics, electronics, machine design and programming. Mechanical engineering programs have developed courses and laboratories in controls and mechatronics. These courses mostly rely on specialized laboratory equipment, LEGO robots, board-level electronics, interfacing and microprocessor programming. The industry expectation is more about system integration, selecting components from industrial product catalogs, calculations to match design requirements and programming of multi-axis motion controllers. In this paper, a senior-level Automation course with laboratory is presented. Lectures present design of automated machinery through industrial component selections and through software design for integration. The laboratory has several miniaturized, simplified machines representing various industrial sectors. The paper explains the course content, the machinery and the weekly laboratory exercises.

	abstract = {The paper considers the problem of accuracy assurance during part manufacturing. Ensuring the required accuracy is one of the aspects of achieving the level of quality, implied during product design. It should start even before the actual manufacturing process, during process planning, which is one of the main stages in product life-cycle. In digital manufacturing, while using automatic and semi-automatic equipment, including CNC machines, a multi-operational technological process must be reliable in the context of ensuring its accuracy parameters, i.e. must guarantee in advance the compliance with requirements of dimensional accuracy and surfaces location and orientation which is specified in a part drawing. This can be achieved by carrying out a dimensional accuracy analysis of a technological process at its design stage, which will reduce time and material costs when introduced in production, due to a significant decrease in the probability of obtaining defects, related to precision parameters. When conducting a dimensional accuracy analysis of a technological process, it is necessary to preliminarily create diagrams of linear dimensions and circular runouts. Creating these diagrams and performing the required calculations manually is a rather time-consuming process. This fact as well as the lack of necessary software packages (even though there exist several programs for calculating linear and diametric dimensions and machining allowances, developed by authors of the present paper) today at industrial enterprises engineers do not conduct dimensional accuracy analysis when designing multi-operational manufacturing processes and rely solely on their own experience and the experience of adjusters and CNC machine operators. And this, in turn, holds back the process of manufacturing process automation, which is unacceptable during the transition to digital manufacturing. As a solution to this problem, it is proposed to introduce into the practice of technological process design developed calculation programs and a software tool in development, based on methods of interactive synthesis of linear dimensional and runout diagrams, described in the paper. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) has revolutionized the manufacturing paradigm for fabricating medium to large scale metallic parts featuring high buy-to-fly ratios such as aerospace components. As a promising technology for the manufacturing industry, it is necessary to develop an automated WAAM system with high efficiency and low labour cost. Generally, to achieve a fully intelligent WAAM system, the first step is to develop an intelligent weld bead modelling system which is able to provide users with appropriate welding parameters in terms of producing components with high accuracy. Knowledge from many disciplines, such as computer science, material engineering, mechanical engineering, and industrial system engineering, is advantageous to develop such an automated system. Thus, an intelligent bead modelling system was developed by integrating a number of industrial sectors in this study. The bead modelling system includes three critical modules, including data generation module, model creation module, and welding parameter generation module. It is worth mentioning that a novel algorithm using Support Vector Machines (SVM) was proposed for creating the model with a high level of accuracy. Optimal combinations of wire feed rate and travel speed under various temperatures were generated accordingly. The experiment results demonstrated that the system can significantly improve product quality and reduce manufacturing costs, including raw material usage and manual labour. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

However, these current methods mainly focus on monitoring the stationary vibrations of time-invariant systems or structures, which cannot deal with the time-varying conditions. In this paper, a video camera is used to monitor the non-stationary vibrations of a time-varying structure for an unexplored usage of moving mass detection. In the study, the laboratory time-varying structure is a clamped beam with one or more masses sliding on. The general parameterized time-frequency transform is first introduced to extract the time-dependent instantaneous frequencies (IFs) from the video motions. Then a parameterized mathematical model is proposed to estimate the weight of the moving mass based on the extracted IFs. By optimizing the parameters in this model, the moving mass can be estimated with high precision. Besides, multi-moving masses can be also detected for abnormal mass classification and identification. Both the finite element method (FEM) and experiments are performed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed vision-based moving mass detection (VMMD) technique. The VMMD technique has valuable potential for online detection, localization and classification of inferior products with abnormal mass in industrial automation. © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Automotive is currently one of the most rapidly evolving industries in the world. Topics such as ride-sharing, connectivity, electrification and automation saw the fastest developments in the industry. These include the more extended influence of software and computer science expertise into the previously a more mechanical-engineering based industry. However, complex software development is a relatively new topic for the automotive industry, which brings a lot of challenges which were unforeseen in the past. For example, changes in development methodology have seen the discussions of agile methodology adoption into the said industry. Moreover, concepts inherent to the field of software engineering, such as 'technical debt' and 'feature prioritization' which arose due to unsystematized software development should also be highlighted. To yield the new innovations into the market safely, the challenges of software development for emerging technologies in the automotive industry should be understood. This paper highlights the challenges related to complex software development in the automotive industry. It highlights the pain points which need to be addressed for further improvements. The paper is aimed specifically at educating the practitioners, researchers, product and business experts in the automotive industry about the importance of producing good software quality for the automotive software-based product. The authors are convinced the paper will benefit the practitioners in the industry as well as the generic audience with interests in this topic. It will also bridge the knowledge gap between ‘computer science'-background and ‘conventional automotive'-background engineers in the automotive software development and safety topics. © 2022 SAE International.

The digital prototype e.g. CAD model is generated for a preliminary module design. Rapid prototyping is used to refine delicate geometry of moving segment before tangible manufacturing. By machine retrofitting we attain a fully automated production that consequently increased efficiency of the line by elimination of the log manual transfer operation. Also, data collection from built-in sensors and analysis provide optimization of the overall equipment effectiveness.

	abstract = {The application of computer-Aided design (CAD) systems belong to the very basic competences that a design engineer in mechanical engineering is taught. The definition of shape and product properties in such systems is the foundation of virtual prototyping and the later manufacturing as well. Depending on the specialization, there exist different capstone courses in engineering design. At Leibniz University of Hannover, the Knowledge-based Design Lab was conceived as project-based learning environment for design automation and product configuration. Its aim is to provide profound knowledge about creating highly flexible but robust CAD models that can self-Adapt to changing requirements to automate routine design tasks. Although already highly activating for the students, input and setup were organized traditionally, i.e. professional skills were developed mainly in the ten attendance phases of the class and the overall course of action has only minor degrees of freedom. This was changed in 2018 when the Knowledge-based Design Lab was transformed into a flipped classroom. In the present article, the author reports about the according transformation process, discusses both the traditional and the flipped classroom and compares the learning outcomes and competences of the graduates of the different formats. To avoid cohort effects, the results of the last three semesters are averaged. © International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education, E and PDE 2020.All right reserved.},

	abstract = {Innovations in Cyber-Physical System (CPS) are driven by functionalities and features. Mechanical Engineering, on the other hand, is mainly concerned with the physical product architecture, i.e., the hierarchical arrangement of physical components and assemblies that forms the product, which is not explicitly linked to these functions. A holistic model-driven engineering approach for CPS, therefore, needs to bridge the gap between functions and the physical product architecture to enable agile development driven by automation. In the theoretical field of mechanical design methodology, functional architectures describe the functionality of the system under development as a hierarchical structure. However, in practice, these are typically not considered let alone modeled. Existing approaches utilizing mechanical functional architectures, however, do not formalize the relation between the functional architecture and the geometric design. Therefore, we conceived a meta-model that defines modeling-languages for modeling functional architectures of mechanical systems and physical solutions, i.e., interconnections of physical effects and geometries, as refinements of the functional components. We have encoded the meta-model as a SysML profile and applied it within an interdisciplinary, industrial project to model an automotive coolant pump. Our contribution signposts the potential of functional structures to not only bridge the gap between function and geometry in mechanics but also to integrate the heterogeneous domains participating in CPS engineering. © 2020 ACM.},

It is shown that from the systematological point of view all existing models are divided into imitation (portrait) and optimization, and the problem of production systems designing belongs to the class of weakly structured problems. Consequently, at the stage of macro-design it is advisable to use optimizing models rather than imitation models. An expanded definition of technological process as a set of production design, technological process design of the sequence of form-building products, manufacturing is given. The concept of production flexibility and production system adaptation to changing conditions is defined. These solutions can be used both in production automation, and in the development of computer-Aided design and modeling systems, flexible production systems, and also fully meet the goals and objectives of procedia engineering.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The quality of teaching in mechanical engineering greatly depends on the practical application of the fundamental theory taught. During COVID-19, limited access to in-class lectures, practical courses with demonstrator plants, and active student participation forced us, an institute of a mechanical engineering faculty in the German higher education system, to transform the teaching strategy in a limited time of one month. For class sizes of between ~25 and ~700 participants, mainly addressing mechanical, electrical and software engineering students, we share challenges and successes in our transformation strategy during April-October 2020. Furthermore, we present a collection of suitable tools, their functions, advantages, disadvantages, and feedback from three sources to provide profound assessment and adaptation criteria in digital teaching. Using quantitative evaluations of four lectures in automation and information systems over the past five years, we highlight the experience from the students’ perspective and evaluate our digital teaching methods compared to well-established in-class formats. This compilation of causes and consequences clarifies the effort involved in achieving the result and discusses the potential of digital teaching or hybrid teaching in engineering. © 2021, Interaction Design and Architecture(s).

	abstract = {Engineering Technology (ET) programs focus on the hands-on approach to engineering education. To keep pace with the rapid growth of industrial technology in the area of automation and artificial intelligence, ET programs need to introduce students to cutting-edge hands-on interdisciplinary project experiences. In this paper, such a pilot project is discussed where ET students at Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK have been exposed to state-of-the-art autonomous vehicle technology as an interdisciplinary senior design project. The project was introduced as a competition among teams consisting of electrical engineering technology (EET), fire protection safety engineering technology (FPSET), and mechanical engineering technology (MET) students. The objective of the project was to design a vehicle that can autonomously navigate a specified course at high speed while completing an assigned mission. The learning outcomes of the project are: (1) evaluate students for their ability to think beyond the classroom education while solving an important societal problem, (2) gain experience working in an interdisciplinary team of students with diverse backgrounds, and (3) increase the synergy among the EET, FPSET, and MET programs for a future graduate degree program in Mechatronics and Robotics. It is observed that the ET students are willing to learn and adapt to the latest open source technologies in their projects, such as OpenCV for camera vision and image processing. The paper focuses on three important aspects of the project from the perspective of ET students. First, the approaches of ET students in handling cutting-edge technology as an open-ended problem. Second, approaches of the instructors to facilitate the two-semester project along with the lessons learned. Third, both the instructor and student experiences during the project. The paper also includes sample material for project specifications, milestones, feedback, and reporting procedures along with the challenges encountered by both the students and the instructors. The paper also presents the analysis of the student outcomes accessed by the instructors, student comments, and discussion on methods to increase student motivation, participation, and project evaluation. This paper will serve as a teaching aid for the instructors who are currently teaching or plan to teach senior design in the near future. Most specifically, this will help newly joined junior faculty members in planning the senior design course and adapting some of these material and reporting procedures. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.},

Application of modern technologies in production leads to delegating human functions to equipment and automatic devices.

The paper describes the use of fuzzy logic control for the high-level control systems of the Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV), using in the mechanical engineering. One of the primary functions of AGVs is the automatic motion planning required for their autonomous navigation. A mathematical model of fuzzy control of the AGV was developed by software control of the electric motor powerof the AGV depending on the speed and distance to the obstaclein order to achieve smooth and precise stopping. The Mamdani algorithm is proposed and implemented in the MATLAB software product as a fuzzy inference algorithm. The rules of the fuzzy inference system are formulated based on the knowledge and experience of experts, as well as modeling the operator's work. Formalization of the description of the speed of AGV, the distance to the obstacle and the electric motor power are carried out by specifying of linguistic variables. The proposed mathematical model can be used in the design of control systems for other types of AGVs. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The article describes the prospects of using composite materials in industry, issues of process preparation of such materials. The ways to solve the issue of automation of process preparation of products made of modern composites are represented. Prospects for effective use of composites as structural materials are seen in increasing the degree of automation of process preparation at the stage of making reasonable technical and economic decisions on the choice of composite for mechanical engineering products instead of common materials. Besides, there is an urgent need to process a large amount of information on such materials, which is a deterrent for representatives of production department. The way out of the issue is seen in the creation of software products that will reduce the time for process preparation and will enable automated and reasonable choice of composite materials taking into account available production data and varying comparability conditions. This will not only increase the performance of the procedure of organizational and technological process preparation of products made of composite materials, but also increase the demand for products made of such materials, and will also allow up-to-date information on available products, materials and tools, their physical, mechanical and operational properties. The method of creating software products for composing and editing a database of composite materials and a software for reasonable selection of composite in the conditions of a given priority of material characteristics taken from the created database is presented. The description of the main features of the created software is represented. The modules will reduce time costs and increase the efficiency of the process preparation due to the automation, as well as allow reasonable and quick decision on the choice of rational material.  © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Outcome in the traditional setting of chalkboard teaching, students tends to remain in the passive mode and do not actively participate in the teaching and learning process. As a result of this, they may lose interest in the course content and conceptual understanding declines. It directly impacts their performance in the examination. With the use of active learning strategies, the subject teacher plays the role of facilitator and creates a conducive environment for students to actively participate in the teaching learning process. This paper discusses effective use of various active learning techniques implemented for the course of ‘Automation and Control Engineering’ for Third year undergraduate Mechanical Engineering Program at CCEW. Techniques such as expert lecture, open ended assignments, YouTube video for animation were employed for content delivery in theory as well as laboratory sessions. Performance evaluation was carried out by using techniques such as google quizzes and group activity on hydraulic and pneumatic trainer kit. Students' perceptions about the implementation of these active learning techniques are studied and analyzed which are reported in this paper. It is observed that as the results of this implementation students' overall understanding of the course content is enhanced. © 2022, Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we present our pilot study of the correlations between the scores of engineering assignments and several task-independent features. This work aims to identify features that can subsequently be used in a machine learning framework to support automated grading. We also identified some interesting patterns in this dataset. Our result shows that length features such as word count may indicate a highly structured assignment's quality, and the number of grammar errors has the potential to be part of the evaluation if we use a carefully designed grammar checker. The present study is expected to contribute to our understanding of automated grading of mechanical engineering technical reports and provide insights into rubric design for assignments. © 2022 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

The most important requirements for technological equipment are an increase in work processes, flexibility and adaptability, automation, implementation of complex algorithms of executive movements. The mechanisms of executive movements ensure the operation of transporting, fixing and other target mechanisms, this largely determines the quality and efficiency of processing processes. Positional actuators have existing technical solutions. However, to a greater extent they relate to linear movements realized by rod cylinders, this does not allow adapting the results of existing research to the development of long-stroke positional movements. In the course of this work, an assessment was made of the existing types of drives and a displacement and position measurement sensors. The proposed positional pneumatic scheme allows solving the problem of positioning long-stroke displacements, its mathematical and computer models were built, and dynamic analysis and conclusions were made. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

In the field of mechanical engineering, the laser technology reaches the biggest increase in the automotive industry, mainly due to the introduction of automation utilizing 5-axial movements. Modelling and numerical simulation of laser welding processes has been exploited with many advantages for the investigation of physical principles and complex phenomena connected with this joining technology. The paper is focused on the application of numerical simulation to the design of welding parameters for the circumferential laser welding of thin-walled exhaust pipes from theAISI 304 steel for automotive industry. Using the developed and experimentally verified simulation model for laser welding of tubes, the influence of welding parameters including the laser velocity from 30 mm.s-1 to 60 mm.s-1 and the laser power from 500 W to 1200 W on the temperature fields and dimensions of fusion zone was investigated using the program code ANSYS. Based on obtained results, the welding schedule for the laser beam welding of thin-walled tubes from the AISI 304 steel was suggested. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Robot technology has played a significant role on the automation of manufacturing industries and the substantial improvement of productivity over the past half century. Robots are composed of various sophisticated technologies related to different fields such as mechanical engineering, control systems, electronics, and computer science. Under these circumstances, technology convergence among these fields could be one of the key factors to drive innovation. The understanding of this innovation is crucial for industries to make decisions whether to focus on technologies as their core competence, or to introduce them by collaborating with others. In addition, it is also critical for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers to assess which policies and measures should be taken. This study aims to analyze the technology convergence in the field of robotics, and to propose an objective methodology to evaluate the differences and characteristics of technological portfolios among major robot-related organizations. This analysis, based on a citation network to patents was made for cases where the scope of the technologies, such as the robot technologies described in this paper, is relatively similar and it is difficult to identify the differences among organizations using only the International Patent Classification (IPC). © 2018 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, Inc.

	abstract = {A mechatronic system is a special application of mechanical engineering with a more focus on automation using emerging technologies such as computer sciences, electronics, and control instead of entirely mechanical elements. In recent years, mechatronics plays an important role in automated food industry. Apple is one of horticultural products that contain valuable nutrient. External appearance of apple is one of the important factors affecting the market price and customer satisfaction. By now, various machines have been developed for automated sorting of fruit and vegetables but still major grading and sorting operations are manually preformed in the packing houses. Computer vision provides an automated, non-destructive, cost-effective and objective technique to satisfy these needs. In this study, various components of the computer vision inspection systems for quality evaluation of apple are reviewed. Recently, infrared (IR) imaging, multispectral imaging (MSI) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) systems are also being used as advanced techniques, which could acquire high quality spatial and spectral information for online quality and safety inspection of agricultural products. Therefore, the current article includes various research conducted in these domains as well. Finally, different pattern recognition techniques for apple defect detection and the stem-calyx region identification are discussed. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {This article addresses the development of a control system design methodology to make control courses easier to understand. The methodology can be handled in four stages: Modeling, controller design and tuning of the controller gains, simulation, and experimental studies. A PC-based control system environment is chosen to help students/researchers understand the control system both theoretically and experi-mentally. An electro-hydraulic system is used for training. Such fluid power systems are widely used in the industrial area and combine different engineering system properties. First, a system is defined by a mathematical model and simulated using the MATLAB/Simulink environment. An easy to use toolbox, Simscape/Simhydraulics, is used to facilitate the modeling phase in simulation of the hydraulic system. Next, the design of the feedback controller is proposed. Basic controllers in control education, such as proportional + derivative + integral (PID) and a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC), are utilized, and the gains of the controllers are tuned with a simplified method according to the given design criteria. The proposed tuning method can also be useful for overdamped or first-order systems. Time and frequency responses of the system are obtained and evaluated. The experimental studies are conducted on a hydraulic control system at the Automatic Control Laboratory of the Mechanical Engineering Department of Uludağ University. This work aims to train engineering students/researchers both theoretically and practically regarding PC-based control system design and fluid power systems. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {It is usually a common task that walking on irregular terrain for a hexapod robot. This paper treats the problem of control of a hexapod robot that has been developed in a collaborative project of the Departments of Mechanical Engineering and Automation at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. We derive the hexapod robot’s kinematics and dynamics models, which are non-periodic, nonlinear, hybrid and open-loop unstable. In order to solve this challenge, we compute a transverse linearization about the desired motion which is a linear impulsive system. The real environment, where the robot performs tasks, are usually unstructured and dynamic, it is always difficult to know the size of obstacles the robot strikes on. In order to reduce its reliance on terrain information for locomotion control to the minimum, taking account of physical constraints, we propose a constrained model predictive controller for stabilization of non-periodic trajectories of the hexapod robot walking over irregular terrain. We prove the stability of the proposed controller theoretically. In the end we perform several simulations and experiments to verify the effectiveness of the control algorithm we proposed. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

It is shown that in terms of systemology, all the existing models are divided into the imitating (replicating) and optimising ones, while manufacturing system design belongs to semi-structured issues. Therefore, at the macro-designing stage one should use optimising models, rather than the imitating ones. The study provides a broad definition of the technological process as a set of actions aimed at product manufacturing, designing the sequence of relevant steps. It defines production flexibility and adaptation of the manufacturing system to changing conditions.

	abstract = {The last few decades have experienced an explosion of technology, both in industry and in customer products. A large variety of embedded systems from various areas of applications, digital electronics, internet of things, automatically controlled products, and ultimately mechatronics systems are part of the everyday life. The changes in the industries, consumer markets and implicitly in the job markets, impose changes in the academic programs and curricula. Recently, mechatronics undergraduate programs started being developed in 2 or 4 years colleges across the nation, mainly driven by international companies operating in countries that already offer mechatronics degrees ranging from high school to doctoral programs. Most of the time there are independent mechatronics programs, mainly at the community college level, but mechatronics areas of specialization were also developed under either electrical or mechanical engineering programs, through senior elective courses. In the College of Engineering and Technology at Old Dominion University there are currently well established, accredited electrical and mechanical engineering technology programs, and steps are being taken to introduce the option for mechatronics specialization. A mechatronics concentration area was already introduced under the mechanical engineering technology (MET) program with new courses developed to provide skills in mechatronics, hydraulics, and simulation of mechatronics systems, complementing the existing courses focusing on automation, industrial robotics, computer integrated manufacturing, and computer numerical control. The electrical engineering technology (EET) program, with a current curriculum that includes a large number of courses to provide the foundation for mechatronics, is taking its turn in the development of a mechatronics concentration area. This paper discusses the introduction of mechatronics specialization through concertation areas in the mechanical and electrical engineering technology programs at Old Dominion University, with emphasis on the implementation challenges. This specialization model offers students the choice to incline the balance between the electrical and mechanical components of their mechatronics education through their major and minor selection, and in consonance with their individual strengths and preferences. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.},

	abstract = {Timely and efficient rescue missions in disasters such as nuclear accidents, fires, and earthquakes require operating robots to work under high payload. This paper treats the problem of optimal planning and control of a walking-trot gait for a hydraulically actuated quadruped robot that has been developed in a collaborative project of the Departments of Mechanical Engineering and Automation at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. To mitigate the challenges of working with high-fidelity models of this highly complex mechanical system, a kinematics and approximate dynamics model is proposed that is shown to provide an accurate description of the walking motions we wish to study while at the same time being simple enough to support analysis. The proposed model is used to design limb movements in a walking trot gait that balance the trade off between energy consumption and the speed of execution of a desired mission. Bezier curves of different orders are used to design trajectories of the robot’s limbs. We verify the accuracy of the proposed model through experiments with the actual robot. We apply hierarchical optimization method to minimize the energy consumption, and we discuss a Pareto optimal solution that trades off mission duration and energy consumption. In the end perform several experiments to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the optimal algorithm we proposed. © 2018, Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems and The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Gravitation energy harvesting of climbed down objects is a promise to harvest unused potential energy from a host building or structure. Similarly, a dynamically dropper mechanism is proved to be a simple and effective electric energy generator, with many practical implementations in power, civil, and mechanical engineering. This research analyzes the prospect of using a mechanism which tends to be near to the elevator structure, but without the counterweight for all possible energy harvesting. To achieve this aim, a dropper structure is supplemented with a new energy storage charging system for both the main kinetic and braking energy harvesting. A prototype of a scaled down system has been built and assumed that the original structure is a one level parking building and all the parked vehicles has a potential energy due to their climbed down to get out, which in turn is harvested by means of a DC generator. The primary goal is to maintain the control process for both; the speed and position by applying equivalent electric load to achieve maximum possible harvest energy from the host structure. Matching voltage and brake generative strategies is used to perform the energy harvesting concept. A polynomial modeling equation have been derived to form expressions of the attained power rate. The maximum power point (MPP) of the system has been extracted to highlight the optimization of system performance. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {One of the most important tasks of modern mechanical engineering is to develop efficient drive mechanisms, possessing high accuracy, security, and significant load capacity at low weight and dimensions. For a successful solution of this problem, the improved research methods and the automation of design process of technical means, providing the improvement of mechanisms characteristics and the choice of optimal construction parameters, are needed. Cycloidal gears are the perspective types of gear mechanisms. They have a number of advantages: the reliability, working capacity in conditions of dynamic loads, high efficiency, the compactness, and large range of gear ratios. Concerning the question of the improving research methods of characteristics and parameters of cycloidal gears is topical. This article presents the automated technique of the calculation of the size of clearances and deformations, arising between teeth and trowels of cycloidal engagement. An analysis of the influence of profile correction at the size of clearances and deformations, and also at the number of teeth, that simultaneously transmit the load, is cited. The software application, developed by the authors, provides a computer-aided creation of models of cycloidal mechanisms with obtaining the required clearances. On the basis of the correction of geometric parameters of the gear, a recreation of management programs for CNC machines has been automatically carried out. The authors presume a further elaboration of developed software application with the aim of its adaptation for the solution of a wide range of tasks of the research and the modeling of constructive and technological cycloidal gear parameters. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Piezoelectric bending actuators are suitable for a wide range of applications that require deflections in range of hundreds of microns. A variety of applications can be found in almost all fields of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, acoustics, automation, automotive, health care and in countless further application areas of industry and daily life. Piezoceramic compacts, piezoceramic actuators as well as complex units and systems are used. The development of high-efficient and lowcost piezoceramic materials optimized for technical applications allowed for a multiplicity of technical solutions for piezoceramic actuators. The so-called high-effective mass systems provide maximum gain at only 1 kV/mm resulting in a material strain of approx. 2 ppm. Therefore, high-effective piezoceramics show very large piezoelectric coefficients diq representing the ratio between strain and electric field. Inherent hysteresis, drift and creep characteristics are a disadvantage of high-effective piezoceramic materials. Therefore, piezoceramic bending actuators consisting of high-efficient piezoceramics are only suitable for a limited extent, as far as high-Accuracy positioning is concerned. For applications, that require precise switching and exact position control, measures have to be taken for the compensation of the inherent piezoelectric effects such as creep and hysteresis and the compensation of external varying mechanical loads and vibrations. By means of a sensor attached to the bending actuator and an appropriate sensor electronics, the disturbing effects can be detected. The implementation of such a sensor-Actuator system into a closed-loop control allows a compensation of negative effects, thus high-efficient piezoceramics can be used for highaccuracy positioning. In this paper, the focus is laid on a noncontact inductive proximity sensor its principle function is based on eddy current measurement effects offering the possibility of sensor integration in smallest spaces in combination with a high-Accuracy electronic circuit. The essential structure and the operational mode of the non-contact inductive proximity sensor are discussed in detail. © 2017 IEEE.},

For process steps such as separation, handling, and forming different grippers have been developed and assembled to multifunctional end effectors. The main focus lays in the damage-free manipulation of the limb textiles. However, new promising transport technologies for light and nonrigid materials can close the gab of textile transport in garment manufacturing in the future. In addition, digital tracking with radio-frequency identification will improve the overall efficiency of material flow in production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With recent trends in manufacturing automation, such as Industry 4.0, control software in automated production systems becomes more and more complex and volatile, complicating and increasing importance of quality assurance. Test tables are a widely used and generally accepted means to intuitively specify test cases for automation software. However, each table only specifies a single software trace, whereas the actual software behavior may cover multiple similar traces not covered by the table. Within this work, we present a generalization concept for test tables allowing for bounded and unbounded repetition of steps, 'don't-care' values, as well as calculations with earlier observed values. We provide a verification mechanism for checking conformance of an IEC 61131-3 PLC software with a generalized test table, making use of a state-of-the-art model checker. Our notation is inspired by widely-used paradigms found in spreadsheet applications. By an empirical study with mechanical engineering students, we show that the notation matches user expectations. A real-world example extracted from an industrial automation plant illustrates our approach. © 2017 IEEE.},

Instead of being simple transducers, intelligent sensors are able to retrieve useful information from raw signal. They represent systems with integrated computation and communication capabilities, that run sophisticated and real time applicable algorithms and communicate the necessary information to the other elements of the manufacturing facility. In this paper we present the recent research results in the field of intelligent sensing systems that were accomplished at Laboratory for Manufacturing Automation and Laboratory for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Department for Production Engineering (KaProm) at Faculty of Mechanical Engineering in Belgrade. Presented systems are intended for application in various manufacturing processes, such as machining, assembly, manipulation, material transport, rubber processing lines. They are based on application of different non-stationary signal processing (Discrete Wavelet Transform, Huang-Hilbert transform) and machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques (Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks, bio-inspired algorithms, clustering methods, fuzzy inference mechanisms). The most of developed systems are implemented in embedded devices and their real-world applicability is demonstrated. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

In the first place, technologies are of interest which would enable large-scale, on-site manufacturing of concrete structures in accordance with the demands of contemporary architectural and structural design. The article at hand evaluates the state-of-the-art with respect to these requirements and presents the CONPrint3D concept for on-site, monolithic 3D-printing as developed at the TU Dresden. This concept is driven by the demands and boundary conditions of construction practice. It complies with common architectural norms, valid design codes, existing concrete classes and typical economic constraints. Furthermore, it targets the use of existing construction machinery to the highest possible extent.

The significant interests in humanoid robots and driverless cars exemplify this development trend. While courses on robotics have found their way into Mechanical Engineering curriculum, they are typically offered as electives and tend to be technically centric, not much time being afforded to address the social and ethical implications inherent in its applications. A course module, named 'Robots at Your Service', was developed to engage students to critically think about the social and ethical implications while performing technical research assignments and identifying new opportunities in robotic applications. Active & collaborative learning (ACL), such as jigsaw and gallery walk, are used for effectively engaging students and promoting self-learning. Initial assessments of its first deployment in Spring 2018 showed positive outcomes for its feasibility. This module was developed for an undergraduate junior/senior robotics course; however, its generic format makes it suitable for graduate level adoption as well. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019},

Smaller mold shops that run 10-14 hours can really benefit from implementi1g automation. Red.Icing downtime is key in the use of untended machining, increasing productivity and getting high utilization. Ortner of Absolute reveals that over the past 10 years untended machining has been enabled by smarter machines, not necessarily with controls or the machine itself but with add-ons such as laser tool setters and probes.},

Based on a proposed set of elementary drivetrain components, this article contributes a generic straightforward approach to compute state-space models for various geared drivetrain layouts, including complex hybrid multi-mode transmissions. The modular approach follows Lagrange formalism: The free motion of rigid shafts is subsequently constrained, considering connecting elements like spur and planetary gear sets. The generalized coordinates are determined by a coordinate partitioning method, ensuring a physically reasonable coordinate system. The proposed approach features high potential for automation. This enables drivetrain modeling by non-experts in the field of mechanical engineering. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

The process of reproduction of the enterprise's FA is a socio-economic, complex, artificial, controlled, dynamic, discrete-continuous, stochastic, and open system. The methodology of system analysis was applied to analyze systems of this class, using the principles as follows: purposefulness, detachment, decomposition, functionality, and development. These principles of system analysis are formalized in the form of a complex of various models such as canonical; hierarchical; the composition of system elements; internal structure; functioning and development of the system. This article also shows an imitation-dynamic model of the reproduction of machines and equipment of a machine-building enterprise. The model is developed on the basis of the method of system dynamics and tools of Powersim Studio, which is integrated into the widely used ERP system Sap R/3. The model shown is basic and simulates the process of reproducing equipment in natural form. The model was used as an automation tool for researching various variants of the reproduction of machines and equipment in a machine-building enterprise. The research done allows drawing a conclusion that the built simulation-dynamic model is quite universal and on its basis, it is possible to do various researches concerning various aspects of reproduction of the equipment of the enterprises. © 2018 IEEE.},

This decomposition is a difficult formalized procedure in which a large amount of data is generated, such as the name and description of failures, causes, consequences, manifestations, the probability of occurrence and the criticality of the failure. Critical failure rate is defined as the product of 3 components expressed in scales from 1 to 10 and characterizing the probability of failure during operation; the severity of its consequences and the likelihood of detecting a failure before delivery of the product to the consumer. The operation requires that the participants of the work, firstly, comprehensive knowledge about the investigated object, and secondly, detailed knowledge of the relevant methods and procedures. To effectively decompose a complex product, automation of this process is necessary based on modern approaches to the creation of information systems. The most promising is an integrated approach, combining the methodology of functional modeling of processes in the system and the methodology of information modeling and database design. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

	abstract = {Portable spectrometers designed for users with little technical training must be more robust than spectrometers designed for professionals. Common measurement errors (and in fact any imaginable non-random error) must be accounted for, trapped, and the user gently directed to manipulate the system to yield a valid, useful measurement. Such measurements are likely cost-sensitive, as consumers typically want infinite performance at zero cost. These constraints require either simplicity, automation, or software-driven operation using inexpensive components whose limitations are compensated algorithmically. We describe progress towards an instrument of the latter description, providing absorption, diffuse reflectance, and luminescence measurements to be carried out in a hand-held grating spectrometer. The gratings are plastic films, stacked and mutually rotated to generate hundreds of orders, which in turn are detected by a consumergrade camera chosen to mimic those in typical low-end smartphones. Low camera dynamic range is compensated by observing orders with a wide range of throughputs, such that overall dynamic range in a single exposure may be 12 bits from an 8 bit image. This requires significant effort for wavelength calibration and inter-order intensity normalization. The paper discusses progress in automatic calibration algorithms, software modularization, and method development for quantifying nitrate and phosphate in agricultural runoff. While the overall approach has been established for some years, significant details requiring careful raytracing, numerical analysis, algorithmic modularization and error handling, materials choices, and mechanical engineering for manufacturability are of current importance. © 2018 SPIE.},

The main advantage of convertible over conventional aircraft is that they can take-off and land vertically, practically eliminating the need for a long runway. At the same time, fixed wings allow to improve energy efficiency with respect to multi-copters. To satisfy these objectives, we have chosen a bi-rotor delta-wing design which is described in the first part of the paper. The paper gives a description of the main educational activities of this project emphasizing its multidisciplinary nature. Indeed, one important aspect of this project is that we have had the chance to work with students from various specialities (such as mechanical engineering, embedded systems, avionics and automatic control) on bachelor and master’s levels. Moreover, the end result of this project should provide us with a very interesting experimental test-bench for teaching and research purposes. Finally, this activity is also the opportunity for our students to develop their soft skills such as project management and communication. Copyright © 2019. The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To make the review paper brief only indicative papers are chosen to cover multiple power system operation-based implementation. Care is taken there is lesser repeatation of similar technology or application be reviewed. The indicative review is to take only a representative literature to bypass scrutinizing multiple literatures with similar objectives and methods. A brief review of the slow transition from the traditional to the intelligent automated way of carrying out power system operations like the energy audit, load forecasting, fault detection, power quality control, smart grid technology, islanding detection, energy management etc is discussed. The Mechanical Engineering Perspective on the basis of applications would be noticed in the paper although the energy management and power delivery concepts are electrical. © 2019 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

	abstract = {The automation of instruments and tools (e.g. bone drill) or robotic devices (e.g. needle positioning robot for prostate surgery) for use in interventional MRI (iMRI) is still challenging due to a lack of accurate, affordable and completely metal-free actuators and motors. Inspired by biological muscles, a bionic equivalent known as the fluid muscle actuator (which can be operated pneumatically or hydraulically) is well-known in the mechanical engineering industry. Fluid muscle actuators have multiple beneficial characteristics: they are simple, self-returning, low-friction and can produce relatively high actuation forces at low diameters and pressures. We present two novel designs for metal-free, pneumatic stepper motors for potential application in iMRI. Our stepper motors are powered by simple pneumatic muscles, which are assembled from low-cost off-the-shelf components. Besides, the components of the stepper motor demonstrators were 3Dprinted using a stereolithographic additive manufacturing process (SLA printing). We evaluate the effect of pneumatic muscle length on contractile force and length. Our results demonstrated the functional feasibility of the pneumatic muscle-powered and fully MRI-compatible stepper motor designs. In a next step, we will optimize the motoŕs design, characterize their performance and reliability, and use the stepper motors to power a micropositioning device in iMRI-phantom tests. © 2019 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Boston.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the automation of a number of processes in key industries such as metallurgy, metalworking, mechanical engineering, etc., has increased substantially. Even now different industrial sectors are working fully autonomous, without the need for human presence. At the same time, determining the execution time for certain processes, including those performed by computing devices or automated systems, is crucial for the organization of the overall production process. Moreover, any delay or interruption is associated with significant economic losses. Therefore, there is a particular interest in proposing an approach capable of determining the dependence between the execution time of the automation processes (running on the automated and computing systems) and the reliability characteristics of their elements. This study provides a method based on the performance time of information processes, taking into account the impact of the reliability characteristics of the means for their realization. In the context of this definition, the proposed approach is invariant in terms of the type of information process being implemented, as can be seen from the theoretical background of the research problem. In this study an approach is also proposed to reduce the impact of short-term interruptions by breaking the information process realization into separate, equal in duration, segments. © 2019 IEEE.},

While SPLE is successfully applied for variant management in the domain of software engineering, the approach is still not widely spread in industrial automated production systems (aPS). Previous studies highlight the interdisciplinary nature of aPS as a reason for not applying SPLE, since control software variants and versions also result from changes in other disciplines such as the mechanical engineering department (i.e. exchange of a sensor). Additionally, the software may evolve over decades at the customer site. In order to gain a better understanding of the challenges in the development of aPS and the constraints hindering the use of SPLE, we conducted several interviews with software development engineers from the domain of aPS. The interviews main aim was to get an overview of the current state of variability management and applied planned and unplanned software reuse strategies. Based on these insights, we summarize the main results useable for a transition from currently deployed variability management concepts in aPS to the SPLE approach. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Control of production in mechanical engineering is fulfilled on the basis of orders fulfilment plans. Creation of production plans for small-serial and single enterprises is NP a difficult task. The real production environment is a set of technological equipment, tool rigging and measuring facilities. Fulfilment of the production order comprises distribution of technological operations for each part and assembly unit product in the structure of the order. According to the authors, one of the main problems consists in disparity between the real production environment and models of plans creation production. For the solution of this problem in the article, approach of creation of the general corporative balanced plan is proposed, which is based on the use of a common information space and a single core of planning. When creating the information space for placing of a planning core, authors as the main priority considered production process, e.i. process of transformation of raw materials in a finished articles. Therefore the core of management is presented in the form of set of the functions placed in the center space of management with two measurements. The plan of any subdivision of the enterprise connected with production is formed in the form of projections of technological operations to the corresponding coordinates of a common corporative information space of planning. It provides balance and full synchronization of plans of subdivisions of the enterprise.) © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Supervised machine learning as a data mining tool has seen a huge growth in interest in the recent past, and is being widely used in real-world problems of diverse domains such as informatics, mechanical engineering, automation, and geology, among others. Space shuttle auto landing control using supervised machine learning has been attempted by various researchers previously. It has been seen that the performance of the control system in terms of prediction time and accuracy was determined by the underlying classification algorithm. A few works are available on binary classification of landing control, i.e., manual or automatic. However, the application of support vector machine based classifier has not been researched thus far. Particularly, the support vector machine based classifiers are prevalent in their use as they work really well with distinct segregation margin in greater dimension region. Moreover, owing to the usage of a subset of training instances in the classifier, support vector machine approach is also memory efficient. In this paper, we have less number of tuples and hence reduced training time of the support vector classifier. The primary goal of our experiment is to train the classifier for finding out the situation in which an auto landing would be preferred to manual landing of the space shuttle. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

The paper examines internal and external stakeholders and their influence on curriculum design work from higher education teachers´ point of view. The teachers do not develop curriculum independently of other stakeholders. Instead, the development activity is seen here as a joint effort of both internal and external stakeholders having a common goal of improving curriculum design and practice. In this case, internal stakeholders include the faculty, the students, and the higher education teachers’ own community while external stakeholders refer to the higher education policy and the labour market. The aim of the paper is twofold: Firstly, to analyse and make visible what kind of influence various stakeholders have on curriculum design work in product development education, and secondly, to discuss the ways in which higher education curriculum can be improved as a collaborative process between internal and external stakeholders. © 2019 Institution of Engineering Designers, The Design Society.

	abstract = {Mechanisms have been around for millennia dating back to the Egyptians. More recently, the slider-crank mechanism was invented by Leonardo da Vinci over 500 years ago. Up until 30 years ago, the design of mechanisms was mechanical, but in the present mechatronic age, the design is multidisciplinary, i.e., mechanical, electrical, electro-mechanical, hydraulic, and pneumatic. Mechatronics is the synergistic integration of physical systems, electronics, controls, and computers through the design process, and is the best practice for synthesis by engineers driven by the needs of industry and human beings. One of the most common mechanisms in the world is the slider crank. Its most common application is the internal combustion engine, but it is also used in an automatic toothbrush. A mechatronic approach to the design and implementation of any mechanism has been developed and is applied in a case study to the slider crank. The approach reflects both the traditional mechanism analysis and synthesis methods together with the best industry practices, e.g., Rockwell Automation, Procter & Gamble. The mechatronic mechanism design process was implemented, and a slider crank was built to accomplish a prescribed task. This process was used in Mechanical Engineering Senior Capstone Design during the fall 2018 semester. Seven design teams, with four students in each team, created four-bar mechanism applications using this mechatronic process, first creating a MatLab Simulink virtual prototype of the complete system, and then building a working prototype with LabVIEW and the NI myRIO. The 7 four-bar mechanisms were: robot gripper, quick return, pick and place, windshield wiper, landing gear, flipping mechanism, and straight line. This paper documents this capstone design experience, including extensive student evaluation of the course. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019.},

	abstract = {Within the framework of understanding by the authors of the world on the eve of the new sixth technological order, the article analyzed the technological patterns in the context of their impact on the textile industry. Thefirst technological structure - mechanical engineering, which originated in the textile industry then had a significant impact on other industries. The invention of the steam engine and machine production in the 19th century served as the key to the transition to the second technological order and turned textile manufactories into large mechanized factories, marking Industry 1.0 and the first industrial revolution. The third technological order, based on the creation of an eclectic engine, presented the textile industry with an automatic weaving machine, and the whole world received mass in-line production, a second industrial revolution, and Industry 2.0. The chemical industry, of the fourth technological order, brought synthetic fiber, which significantly affected the textile industry's ability to create materials with new qualities, such as heat resistance, strength and durability, tolerance to aggressive media. The latter is today - the fifth technological mode, based on the automation of production and the introduction of information, the technologists caused the transition to the third industrial revolution and Industry 3.0. It is the aggregate technologies from the first to thefifth technological order that put the world on the threshold of the new industrial revolution and Industry 4.0 today.

	abstract = {The academic performance of most engineering students has been unsatisfactory in math and physics courses. This work proposes the construction of a measurement for evaluating students' academic performance based on grades and numbers of failures, associating this performance measurement to dropout percentages. This performance measurement proposed in this study aims to identify and track students who perform poorly in the initial semesters in order to monitor them during the program. The performances of 1622 students in math and physics courses in the first two years of engineering programs were analyzed. Daytime programs analyzed were: Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Mining Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and Sanitary and Environmental Engineering. Evening programs were: Production Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Control and Automation Engineering. Descriptive analyses of the data, Spearman correlation tests, Mann-Whitney tests and Poisson regression models were performed. Results obtained showed an association between the proposed performance measurement and the students' entrance and exit forms in the programs. It was found that the majority of students performance below median in mathematics and physics courses. There was an inversely proportional relationship between the performance measurement and dropout levels, and higher risks for dropout in the first two performance quartiles, which are the lowest. The analysis based on the Generalized Linear Model, using Poisson regression, presented consistent and statistically significant estimates of relative risk. These analyses indicate that students with the lowest performances in the Analytical Geometry, Calculus I, Calculus II, and General and Experimental Physics I E courses are twice as likely to drop out of engineering courses when compared to students with higher performances. © 2020 TEMPUS Publications.},

	abstract = {Kitting is a common approach of materials supply with mixed-model assembly, by which components are supplied to the assembly process in pre-sorted kits. With kitting, the kit preparation is a labour intensive process and order batching is often applied to enhance efficiency. Here, improved quality and efficiency by means of automation is desirable, but knowledge of the potential of collaborative robots to support kit preparation with order batching is lacking. The purpose of this paper is to identify the potential of cobots to support time-efficient kit preparation with order batching, when the pick task is performed manually and a cobot carries out the sort task. A modelling approach is applied with experimental data from laboratory experiments to compare the cycle time between fully manual and cobot-supported kit preparation with order batching. The findings suggest that a cobot-supported sort task leads to a comparable average cycle time, with less variability of the cycle time, when compared to the fully manual setup. The paper contributes several insights on the application of cobots to support kit preparation, and the model developed in the paper can be used by practitioners to assess the potential of cobots to support their processes for kit preparation. © 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {China's coal resources are very rich, and it is the world's largest coal producer and consumer. In China's energy industry, coal accounts for about 70% of China's primary energy production and consumption structure, and is expected to account for more than 50% by 2050. Therefore, coal will remain China's main energy source for a long period of time. At present, the rapid growth of China's economy has put forward higher requirements for the development of the coal industry. With the rapid economic growth, the increase in coal demand has also brought a series of problems. In recent years, China's coal mine accidents have occurred frequently. Mobile robots involve various high-end technologies such as information processing, mechanical engineering, and automation control. Mobile robots can move freely, so they can replace workers in hazardous or harsh environments. Because of its self-organizing, running, and planning functions, it has greater flexibility and flexibility than general robots. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Prefabricated construction promotes providing better productivity and project results. Building models, including their elements' fabrication details, are complex structures that need accurate information delivery among the project participants and their partial designs. This paper extends the IFC data model to support prefabricated construction. Also, it discusses the advantages of systematically managing exchange requirements in a database to facilitate generating IDM (Information Delivery Manual). The paper first introduces a BIM-based collaborative work mode by sharing and extracting the model views. The core of the sharing is the establishment of view exchange standard about the linked model and the definition of exchange requirements based on the design process, leading to the formulation of the IDM standard again from the perspective of the actual design. Process maps covering architecture, structure, plumbing, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering are made to show how to realize BIM-based collaborative work. Then the exchange requirements referred to the object and attribute of the BIM model which should be delivered in a special phase are defined in particular tables. To facilitate the automation of managing and exchanging requirements, a database management system is designed with its corresponding user-interface, which enhances the collaboration and delivery throughout the project life cycle. The proposed approach supports better information reuse and delivery among the project participants. © 2020 Zhao Xu et al.},

Application of the spectral method to the synthesis of electric drive control systems is under consideration. The wavelet spectrum processing capability estimation under the conditions of digital implementation of the controller and automatic control systems in general is given. It is proposed to use a system of basis functions different from the traditional one. Main requirements to basis functions are considered. The approach based on the integrated form of equations is proposed and its advantages for solution of the set problems are revealed. The conditions for the generating wavelet are stated and the possibility of numerical implementation based on the function of inverse wavelet transform is shown. It is illustrated that the dyadic wavelet transform of signals meets the basic requirements for basic functions systems. The suggested method guarantees that, in case of arbitrary increase of the rank members, the loss of the synthesis algorithm numerical stability would only be concerned with the peculiarities of the computer and the implementation of linear algebra algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.},

Therefore, manufacturing systems work under uncertainty when their current state cannot be identified and which leads to some difficulties in determining the way of corrective control action. One of the critical stages in determining manufacturing system capacity is volume planning which, consequently, influences the whole system of division plans. The uncertainty in decision-making can be decreased with “advice” automated systems when Control Subjects are making agreed decisions. The research describes the problem of making agreed decisions for volume manufacturing plans. An automated technological process control system generates options of control actions, with experts analyzing and assessing them, then choosing the most feasible one with fuzzy sets.

A 3D simulation of the annealing of a square glass sheet on a metal support structure is considered. When using surface simulation models only, it is not evident that there are critical zones inside the annealed sheet since the tension zone is limited in size and tensile stresses are low. When using the models, it is proven that there is a sensitive zone around the corner of the sheet for the surface not in contact with the support structure. There is also a sensitive zone in the middle of the sheet widthwise for the surface in contact with the support structure.},

	abstract = {The Manufacturing Automation course in a standard engineering education prepares students for the most contemporary production and technology challenges. This paper describes Rapid Prototyping and Modeling done as subtractive and additive manufacturing operations in the scope of the UConn Engineering program, as well as its integration into the Manufacturing Automation course. It is a companion paper with IMECE 2014-38355 [1] that reports how students of Manufacturing Automation are exposed to rapid prototyping. This is done in the UConn School of Engineering Machine Shop, Mechanical Engineering Machine Shop and Laboratory of the desk top modelers. Some experience students gain also in MEM Prototyping Laboratory and during class trips to Pratt & Whitney/ UConn Additive Manufacturing Research Laboratory and to CNC Software Inc Experimental Testing Shop. One of the objectives of the course is to introduce students to the processes of advanced Subtractive and Additive Manufacturing (SM and AM). The CAD/CAM cutting software such as CAMM-3 Micromodeler, G-code and Mastercam were used successfully in those operations. The elements of CAD/CAM software were integrated in the model cutting exercises. Full automation of integrated design and manufacturing data exchange was attempted but was found still not possible to accomplish. However the use of automation software in a sequence, tin tandem with data export and import, marks a significant step forward towards integrated manufacturing automation. The research to accomplish the next level of automation will be continued and the results will be applied to reinforce the teaching and practice of Manufacturing Automation. Significant role in helping students to understand the methods of subtractive and additive manufacturing has cooperation with two Connecticut companies that achieved outstanding results in modeling and prototyping. These are Pratt & Whitney in East Hartford and CNC Software Inc in Tolland, Connecticut. The class visits to their facilities and experience with their equipment played a significant role in understanding of the subtractive and additive machining processes. Efforts to introduce students to the concepts of subtractive and additive machining process are described. Conclusions about the teaching methods of product machining concepts and lessons learned are pointed out. Copyright © 2015 by ASME.},

The application area employed is robot force control, which has been the focus of much research during the past three or more decades. In this work, a robot is modelled in MATLAB and Simulink as a simple one degree-of-freedom 'arm', which is based on a velocity-controlled DC motor. The paper describes the development of this model and how it can be approximated as a standard second-order system from step response data. Three example solutions for designing a suitable force controller are then discussed, for a situation where the stiffness of contact at the robot/task interface is known and constant. The approach can be used in conjunction with a more traditional course in automatic control, or act as standalone tutorial for those with a more specific interest in force control. © 2015 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Surgical robots provide various advantages, such as improved precision and dexterity, over conventional surgical procedures and have been extensively studied in the last decade. Many surgical robots have been recently developed and described in the literature. However, given their multidisciplinary nature, due to the involvement of medical surgery, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer science, very few existing documents provide a system design perspective of a complete surgical robot. We tend to fill this gap by presenting the complete system-level design of Al-Zahrawi, which is a new telesurgical robotic system. The Al-Zahrawi system is mainly composed of two parts, i.e., a master console and a slave console, which are connected through a communication link. The master console consists of master manipulators (MMs), visual information presentation apparatus, and foot pedals. The slave console is primarily composed of three slave manipulators (SMs): The left and right manipulators are equipped with surgical instruments, whereas the middle one holds the endoscope. All the manipulators utilize the modified double parallelogram mechanism to achieve the remote center of motion. The distinguishing features of this system include: 1) a custom-made simple-in-construction user-friendly MMs; 2) a modular SM, with an interchangeable instrument module that does not contain any electronic circuitry and thus can be completely sterilized with ease; and 3) the availability of an independent forceps jaw movement, which increases the dexterity of the surgical tool tip without using the wrist mechanism. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The ongoing globalization in almost all markets leads to a wide range of IT-related challenges. Focusing on development processes in mechanical engineering disciplines as they occur in automotive industry, globalization requires a continuously and location-independent provision of software tools and project-oriented data. This involves both supply of a large amount of different commercial software packages for various engineering disciplines as well as handling of large amount of data, configurations, different projects, sites and employee-related information. The broad field of computational design and engineering disciplines within automotive development requires a strong interaction in view of efficient software applications. Especially the CAD-based design phase is characterized by a cooperation of manufacturer and supplier, which often use dissimilar CAD software with different versions or even different vendors. Previous research work focused on development and application of knowledge-based engineering (KBE) applications within a multiple-CAD environment. A method has been proposed for efficient development of KBAs (Knowledge Based Applications), which are able to concurrently support multiple CAD systems and releases. Based on this fundamental approach, the next logical step includes the development of an efficient and secure distribution environment for KBAs. In this context, the present publication introduces a new approach for management and distribution of KBAs, project-related CAD environments and templates, as well as product data quality (PDQ) methods in a worldwide context. © 2016 CAD Solutions, LLC.},

	abstract = {Numerous lessons have been learned from the use of a wide selection of technological elements in the construction of wireline tractors and mechanical services tools. It is well-known that downhole tool design is challenging and requires the use of the latest developments in physics, material science, electronics, mechanical engineering, and software because the tools operate in very harsh environments characterized by extreme pressures, high temperatures, and corrosive fluids. Wireline tractor and mechanical services tools face not only all of these difficulties but also some unique challenges. For example, the tools operate at much higher power levels compared with other wireline tools. The efficient delivery and use of power downhole is an active area of technology development. Another challenge is that the tools interact intensively with the borehole walls or elements of the well completion by exerting very large mechanical forces to tractor along the well, exercise completion elements, mill or cut tubing, remove and collect debris, set or pull plugs, and fish stuck tools. They are also subjected to high shock levels from explosive devices. All of these lead to heavily stressed components. A comparative study has been conducted of a broad range of technologies, from the evaluation of single components such as electric motors to entire systems such as the selection of a drive mechanism, power delivery scheme, or traction control system. The study discusses single- and three-phase AC and DC motors, AC and DC power delivery schemes, reciprocation versus continuous drive mechanisms, power efficiency of downhole systems, downhole electronics challenges, traction control mechanisms, and the impact of technology selection on functional performance and reliability. The choice of components and technologies is not purely a technical decision, and difficulties and best practices related to selection are discussed. Selection criteria also include rigorous qualification testing. The advantages and disadvantages of a broad selection of technological elements have been identified. The value of instrumentation, real-time data acquisition, control, and automation is emphasized. Additionally, the importance of proper job planning is discussed and recommendations made for types of simulations that must be included in job planner software.

A flipped lecture structure was adopted and the course topics were restructured to better facilitate an intuitive grasp of systems and controls. The laboratory activities for the course were restructured around the National Instruments myRIO device and the LabVIEW programming language. Projects were incorporated in the class to give students the opportunity to apply knowledge to open-ended automation and control problems. A comparison of the new and old curricula using course surveys as well as interviews with students from both curricula currently engaged in senior design projects was performed to better understand the impact that the redesign has had on undergraduate SMAC education at Purdue University. © 2016 American Automatic Control Council (AACC).},

	abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution (Industrie 4.0) is distinguished by a growing network and intelligence of machines, products, services and data. This results in new business models and value chains, but also various risks, e.g. by hacker attacks, data theft or manipulation. Many companies consider Industrie 4.0 much as a security challenge other than an opportunity or enabler for new business models. Therefore, effective security methods to protect the Industrie 4.0 systems and its associated values and assets are needed. One of the aims of Industrie 4.0 is identifying and developing new, appropriate security practices for enterprises and especially for their production systems. Based on the connectivity infrastructure in the shop floor, the diversity in the corporate landscape of the global mechanical and plant engineering ultimately causes that every company has to develop its own way of IT and production security management. In the context of Industrie 4.0, an integral concept is needed, that connects the requirements from manufacturing automation and mechanical engineering to process engineering with the properties of cyber-physical systems as an Industrie 4.0 component and well-established core elements of IT security descriptions. Standards from industry associations and standardization committees have to be included. In this paper, a process model is developed, which consults RAMI 4.0 and well-established core elements of safety and IT security considering the standards IEC 61508 and IEC 62443. A use case driven approach is developed with the goal to demonstrate the functionalities and validation of the process model. In different iterations, the dynamic change of the system by mapping IT security requirements on system assets and processes will be presented. The purpose of the developed process model is to assign security measures to vulnerabilities and threats of a system for Industrie 4.0. © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier.},

A large part of this new knowledge can be applied to mechatronics or fields close to it. It may be argued that new knowledge and skills qualitative perfection can only be guaranteed by proportion of sufficient practical and laboratory works in the studies and the students' interest in these works. Therefore, cost-effective, functionally varied and creative interest technical learning aids are viewed that can be used for practical and laboratory classes as well as in product design model creation with mechatronics elements. The technical aids functionality and quality can be increased by adding to the elements the 3D printing technology. By using these technical tools, it is possible to create a wide range simple model products, usually in a reduced scale, and the practice do it research, for example, such as the work capacity assessment, to find and prevent constructive imperfections, etc. In practice, the results can be compared with the results that are obtained with traditional calculation or CAE tools. Examples are given. Equipping these models with electric or pneumatic actuators, sensors and programmable control tools can work off these objects various control algorithms. For programming basics acquisition, which is necessary to ensure automated control, teaching mechanics and designers, main attention is given to the skills to write down the machine control algorithm, and at least in the initial learning phase to use visual programming languages, that allows intended and not too difficult work goals to achieve very easily and in a short time.},

	abstract = {Modern mechanical engineering systems are primarily designed to perform a specific system process in an optimal manner. For this purpose, they use control systems that monitor and influence the process with the help of sensors and actuators. Changing control values or (physical) disturbances are recorded and considered by the control systems. Problems arise whenever the disturbances are not physical, but organizational. In these cases, the existing control systems can not react and there are delays and failures in the system process. New trends in automation and information and communication technology can help to bridge this gap in process control by providing intelligent and data-based services in the immediate process environment. Distributed drive systems can assume a key role as they already have the necessary technical requirements. However, these are to be made more flexible. For this purpose, it is necessary to subject both hardware and software production to a systemic approach and to provide the mechanical part of the system process with a digital image. The fact that this increases the complexity in the system production is undisputed. Therefore, in addition to the technical possibilities for solving the problem, the value in use must also be determined and evaluated from the outset in system development. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The classical natural coordinate modeling method which removes the Euler angles and Euler parameters from the governing equations is particularly suitable for the sensitivity analysis and optimization of multibody systems. However, the formulation has so many principles in choosing the generalized coordinates that it hinders the implementation of modeling automation. A first order direct sensitivity analysis approach to multibody systems formulated with novel natural coordinates is presented. Firstly, a new selection method for natural coordinate is developed. The method introduces 12 coordinates to describe the position and orientation of a spatial object. On the basis of the proposed natural coordinates, rigid constraint conditions, the basic constraint elements as well as the initial conditions for the governing equations are derived. Considering the characteristics of the governing equations, the newly proposed generalized-α integration method is used and the corresponding algorithm flowchart is discussed. The objective function, the detailed analysis process of first order direct sensitivity analysis and related solving strategy are provided based on the previous modeling system. Finally, in order to verify the validity and accuracy of the method presented, the sensitivity analysis of a planar spinner-slider mechanism and a spatial crank-slider mechanism are conducted. The test results agree well with that of the finite difference method, and the maximum absolute deviation of the results is less than 3%. The proposed approach is not only convenient for automatic modeling, but also helpful for the reduction of the complexity of sensitivity analysis, which provides a practical and effective way to obtain sensitivity for the optimization problems of multibody systems. © Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

	abstract = {Batteries are a strategic technology to decarbonize conventional automotive powertrains and enable energy policy turnaround from fossil fuels to renewable energy. The demand for battery packs is rising, but they remain unable to compete with conventional technologies, primarily due to higher costs. Major sources of cost remain in manufacturing and assembly. These costs can be attributed to a need for high product quality, material handling complexity, uncertain and fluctuating production volumes, and an unpredictable breadth of product variants. This research paper applies the paradigms of flexibility from a mechanical engineering perspective, and reconfigurability from a software perspective to form a holistic, integrated manufacturing solution to better realize product variants. This allows manufacturers to de-risk investment as there is increased confidence that a facility can meet new requirements with reduced effort, and also shows how part of the vision of Industry 4.0 associated with the integration and exploitation of data can be fulfilled. A functional decomposition of battery packs is used to develop a foundational understanding of how changes in customer requirements can result in physical product changes. A Product, Process, and Resource (PPR) methodology is employed to link physical product characteristics to physical and logical characteristics of resources. This mapping is leveraged to enable the design of a gripper with focused flexibility by the Institute for Machine Tools and Industrial Management (iwb) at the Technical University of Munich, as it is acknowledged that mechanical changes are challenging to realize within industrial manufacturing facilities. Reconfigurability is realised through exploitation of data integration across the PPR domains, through the extension of the capabilities of a non-commercial virtual engineering toolset developed by the Automation Systems Group at the University of Warwick. The work shows an "end-to-end" approach that practically demonstrates the application of the flexibility and reconfigurability paradigms within an industrial engineering context. © 2017 The Authors.

	abstract = {Rapid technological changes have a large influence in the field of engineering systems. However, just being fast is not sufficient; additionally, the system has to be user-friendly, flexible and cost effective. Serious Games (SG), as fast-paced, immersive, interactive media, have not only become popular in various learning and training environments, including engineering, but there are also several examples on how gamebased mechanisms can be used to enhance User Experience (UX) and performance. So far, gamification of Mechanical Engineering Systems (MES) have not reached their full potential, due to the fact that gamification efforts are costly, time consuming to develop, and require the constant involvement of MES developers even for small changes. Furthermore, its adaption to MES requires specific knowledge in game design and development. Thus, as demand for user friendlier, intuitive interfaces increases, there is also a need for support tools that enable access to design and development of gamification mechanisms for non-SG professionals. In this context, the authors discuss the creation of a library of User Interface (UI) automation tools that enables gamification and through which tutors can create interactive learning scenarios to guide users through the functionalities of engineering systems. Such tools have the potential to support knowledge processes, respectively knowledge experiencing, conceptualizing, analyzing and applying, in engineering environments. © Copyright 2015 by ASME.},

In addition, IBDM is generally a relatively low-cost approach.

	abstract = {The Manufacturing Automation course in the Mechanical Engineering program at the University of Connecticut (UConn) was one of the most popular courses in the ME curriculum. The students' benefits from the course were already described in the companion paper [1]. In this paper the advantages of prototyping and part production through Subtractive Manufacturing (SM) and Additive Manufacturing (AM) are described. The paper discusses parts fabrication done as subtractive and additive manufacturing operations. This was done in the scope of the UConn Engineering i.e. in the ME and MEM programs where Manufacturing Automation and Senior Design courses are taught. Such operations were possible thanks to the equipment available at UConn School of Engineering and thanks to the cooperation with the creator of the Mastercam software - CNC Software Inc and aircraft engines and equipment manufacturer - Pratt & Whitney of East Hartford. The integration of design and manufacturing in the course was done through putting together the operations of conceptual design, geometric design and modeling of the parts designed during the course. The models of parts done by AM were created using 3D printing in ME Laboratory out of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and different kinds of plastic and in PW/UConn laboratory using laser and electron beam AM machines. To demonstrate further integration of design and machining automation, the students were introduced to complicated problems of surfaces crossing, connections of surfaces and edges of cross sections of the tops and valleys. Thanks to the support and cooperation of the CNC Software, Inc., it was possible to show the students how to cut complicated surfaces on different computer numerically controlled (CNC) machines that ranged from three to nine degrees of freedom specifically designed for accurate and repeatable metal working. In addition, the additive manufacturing (AM) capabilities were introduced in the course thanks to the support of Pratt & Whitney/UConn Additive Manufacturing Laboratory located on the UConn campus. The AM machines are Arcam and laser machines that use electron and laser beams to meld titanium powder. The fabricated parts of high strengths are useful as rapid prototypes or in some cases as substitution parts in an existing mechanical systems. Thanks to the UConn Engineering program and support of the corporations: CNC Software, Inc. and P&W, students were introduced to the spectrum of modern Rapid Prototyping and part sintering operations going through subtractive and additive manufacturing. The process details of the theory, practice of operations, and recommendation for use of the technologies discussed above, as well as possibilities of further applications, are described in this paper. After learning the fundamentals of these processes, students are prepared to design and analyze parts as well as the process required for different machining capabilities. Methods to introduce students to the concepts of using laser and electron beams AM machine as well the prototype machining are described in the paper. Conclusions recommending the teaching methods of product SM and AM machining concepts and lessons learned are also pointed out. Copyright © 2016 by ASME.},

So when it decided to replace the aging manufacturing execution system (MES) in one of its factories, it chose the FactoryTalk ProductionCenter (FTPC) from Rockwell Automation. To improve the speed of interlinked quality related communication, system-based feedback and feed-forward mechanism were implemented. The team built data bridges between the old and the new system that could run parallel during the migration process. The data captured by one system was transferred via a data bridge to the other system. Besides reducing manual processing, the new MES connects the plant to the enterprise opening the door to a multitude of production and efficiency gains.},

	abstract = {Automation is one of the key areas for modern manufacturing systems. It requires coordination of different machines to support manufacturing operations in a company. Recent studies show that there is a gap in the STEM workforce preparation in regards to highly automated production environments. Industrial robots have become an essential part of these semi-automated and automated manufacturing systems. Their control and programming requires adequate education and training in robotics theory and applications. Various engineering technology departments offer different courses related to the application of robotics. These courses are a great way to inspire students to learn about science, math, engineering, and technology while providing them with workforce skills. However, some challenges are present in the delivery of such courses. One of these challenges includes the enrollment of students who come from different engineering departments and backgrounds. Such a multidisciplinary group of students can pose a challenge for the instructor to successfully develop the courses and match the content to different learning styles and math levels. To overcome that challenge, and to spark students' interest, the certified education robot training can greatly support the teaching of basic and advanced topics in robotics, kinematics, dynamics, control, modeling, design, CAD/CAM, vision, manufacturing systems, simulation, automation, and mechatronics. This paper will explain how effective this course can be in unifying different engineering disciplines when using problem solving related to various important manufacturing automaton problems. These courses are focused on educational innovations related to the development of student competency in the use of equipment and tools common to the discipline, and associated curriculum development at three public institutions, in three different departments of mechanical engineering technology. Through these courses students make connections between the theory and real industrial applications. This aspect is especially important for tactile or kinesthetic learners who learn through experiencing and doing things. They apply real mathematical models and understand physical implications through labs on industrial grade robotic equipment and mobile robots. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2015.},

The purpose of this research is to enhance the teaching content of a LT-AGV. The LT-AGV serving as an educational tool is divided into two parts. The first part is the mechanism design of an AGV and the second part is the AGV's control circuit design and implementation. In order to upgrade the LT-AGV's system, plenty engineering designs and manufacturing methods have been developed to improve students' learning outcomes in this research. An experimental analysis method is used to find out the difference of the design parameters through verifing the performance of LT-AGV. After comparing the experimental data of AGV's performance, a more suitable range of design parameters was proposed. Consequently, the investigation of design parameters on the LT-AGV had been accomplished. This new LT-AGV system can serve as an useful tool in teaching.},

	abstract = {Model-based product design using computer simulation has become a standard design practice in most companies in mechanical engineering. However, there is a need for efficient simulation tools that can provide design-supporting information already at early design phase when the most important decisions are made. Design process and design tools need to be agile and enable iterative process where the design and its requirements can effectively be iterated. Low-fidelity models can be part of the solution for time issue in early design phase. Low-fidelity prototypes are simplified representations of functions and concepts in the virtual prototype. Axiomatic design with low-fidelity modelling approach is a promising concept for achieving designsupporting information in an efficient way. In this method, there is a linear mapping between design parameters and system characteristics. Non-linear models of the system are linearized at the nominal point. An engineering design analysis tool (EDA tool) to enhance EDA is constructed and presented in this paper. For evaluation of the usefulness of this tool, a case study is presented. The case study deals with a simple hydraulic crane that is manufactured from steel plate. The results of the case study design are compared with results achieved with conventional CAD and FEM tools. Modelling accuracy and required modelling and simulation efforts are compared in both cases. © 2017 ASME.},

	abstract = {A novel fabrication method of integral wind turbine blade is investigated, which combines in-situ UV curing process and automated fiber placement manufacturing technology in order to improve production efficiency and quality stability of traditional resin transfer molding (RTM) technology. To get the whole initial place path information of the front and rear fringes of the wind turbine blade with great curvature surface, an algorithm using transition line to generate trajectories is presented. The placement trajectories of blade are generated automatically by the secondary development technology based on CATIA CAA. The possible fabrication method of engineering mold for the blade is analyzed, and in-situ UV curing fiber placement fabrication experiments of integral wind turbine blade are carried out to verify the feasibility of the new method. Because the prepregs are placed and wound around the whole blade at any ply angle, and without a cohesive layer between upper shell and lower shell of blade, so the integral blade would exhibit much better whole strength than the two-shell blade. In order to enhance the performances of in-situ UV curing glass fiber reinforced plastic composite, the in-depth research about high quality UV curing prepreg needs to be conducted. © 2014 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

	abstract = {The warehouses of the future will come in a variety of forms, but with a few common ingredients. Firstly, human operational handling of items in warehouses is increasingly being replaced by automated item handling. Extended warehouse automation counteracts the scarcity of human operators and supports the quality of picking processes. Secondly, the development of models to simulate and analyse warehouse designs and their components facilitates the challenging task of developing warehouses that take into account each customer's individual requirements and logistic processes. Automation in Warehouse Development addresses both types of automation from the innovative perspective of applied science. In particular, it describes the outcomes of the Falcon project, a joint endeavour by a consortium of industrial and academic partners. The results include a model-based approach to automate warehouse control design, analysis models for warehouse design, concepts for robotic item handling and computer vision, and autonomous transport in warehouses. Automation in Warehouse Development is targeted at both academic researchers and industrial practitioners. It provides state-of-the art research on warehouse automation and model-based warehouse design. These topics have been addressed from a systems engineering perspective by researchers from different disciplines including software, control, and mechanical engineering, with a clear focus on the industrial applications of their research. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

	abstract = {Minimally invasive surgery and interventional procedures have seen rapid advancement as one of leading trend in medical technology innovation for its distinguished clinical benefit for patient. Robotic systems and technologies have made remarkable contribution to the innovation enabling various innovative devices and procedures including robotic laparoscopic surgery assist system. While robotic systems to assist general surgery seem to become mature technology, robotic systems for interventional procedures and neurological surgery are newly emerging. The minimally invasive procedures have inherent limitations and constraints that make human operation difficult or less optimal. Various medical imaging modalities are utilized as visual sensor for the procedures and each has limitations such as radiation exposure, resolution and sensitivity, real-time imaging capability, electromagnetic interference and etc. Tiny and complex tissue structure through which devices for the minimally invasive procedures perform diagnostic or therapeutic operation is another major limiting condition in terms of dexterity or precision. Robotic systems that converge various electro-mechanical engineering and computer science technologies facilitate human physician overcoming these limitations and achieving better clinical outcome for patient. Computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound guided biopsy is one of long researched applications for robotic system utilization. Several robotic systems for cardiac intervention and neurological surgery are already available for clinical use. The clinical efficacy of the robotic technologies needs further study including large scale randomized clinical study and safety issue with the use of robotic system either in assist or automation manner also need more research. It seems increasingly clear that robotic system technologies will continuously provide answers to many of unmet clinical needs in minimally invasive diagnosis and therapy. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

	abstract = {The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has recently emerged as an efficient tool to adaptively decompose non-stationary signals for nonlinear systems, which has a wide range of applications such as automatic control, mechanical engineering and medicine and biology. A noise-assisted variant of EMD named ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) have been proposed to alleviate the mode mixing phenomenon. In this paper, we proposed an improved EEMD method, namely cardinal spline interpolation based EEMD (C-EEMD), by optimizing the sifting procedure. Specifically, we employ the adjustable cubic trigonometric cardinal spline interpolation (CTCSI) to accurately represent free curves, other than the original one used in the traditional EEMD. The new interpolation approach can be used to build the mean curve in a more precise way. By virtue of CTCSI, we can therefore obtain the mean value curve from midpoints of the local maxima and minima by just one interpolation operations, which saves almost half the computational cost. Extensive experimental results on synthetic data and real EMI signals clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, compared to the state-of-the-arts. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

In this work, it has been tried to amalgamate the research work done related to application of soft computing techniques particularly in the area of mechanical engineering. A lot of researches have being carried out in this domain because it has been a pool of infinite scope for innovative works. This paper gives a quick view of the different applications of AI techniques, such as neural networks, fuzzy logic, neurofuzzy (NF), simulated annealing (SA), genetic algorithm (GA), genetic programming (GP), and data mining (DM), and provides a conscious view in the different paradigms of mechanical engineering where the soft computing techniques are separately used and even in combination with one another to perform certain tasks which if performed by human becomes a dreary task. Several applications of soft computing have been proposed in the literature to solve the problems related with complicated mechanical systems. It is felt that a review of the application in various mechanical areas would help to compare their main features and their relative advantages or limitations to allow choose the most suitable technique for a particular application and also throw light on aspects that needs further attention. © Springer India 2015.},

X-plane flight simulator will be used with Matlab wherein the estimated model is imported and simulated for its practical behavior. A longitudinal state-space model of the Puma, SA330 research helicopter is used as a reference model. First, the model is described and with standard reference input test signals, output data set is generated, then this input-output dataset is used for system identification purpose. Both traditional methods such as subspace & prediction-error minimization (PEM) method along with modern ways of identification methods such as neural networks are used. A practical comparison between used identification methods and best suitable type of input for estimation is discussed. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Engineering is one sector dramatically affected by the changes in human activities. The technological revolution and the work market are demanding more flexibility, extra qualifications and more knowledge of specific areas from the upcoming engineers. Engineering universities intend to increase the efficiency in learning demanding methodological quality changes in the curriculum. The Project Based Learning (PBL) is a systemic approach, which consists of students to ‘know how’ and knowledge acquisition through the investigation of complex questions, tasks and products, and accurate planning focusing on efficient learning. In the PBL approach, the student is responsible for obtaining knowledge on their own. Domotic can be defined as the automatized services applied to one house. Under the technical aspects, one domotic network can be represented by one group the automated services that are linked and that realize several different functions. These functions can be connected through an external or internal communication net. The house automation functions as safety, children care, temperature control, entry access and lighting setting, all can be controlled by a microprocessor. The Arduino electronic board is a cheaper and more efficient solution which can be applied in a house automation design for the academic applications purposes. The purpose of this work is to analyze the performance of PBL as the foundation of a house automation design developed by Mechanical Engineering students. It commenced by explaining to the students the new learning methodology considering the input data. The class was divided in groups responsible of one house automation to handle anything. Each group created a timetable for all activities, the basic tasks being: key points in the house automation conception, project layouts, purchase, assembly, try run and presentation for final approval. Concluding this study, the results of the PBL efficiency measurement are presented as well as improvement recommendation for future projects. © 2016, University of Minho. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {It is well known that in mechanical engineering production systems, an estimated 15-30% of the manufacturing cost is towards deburring operations. While small components may be deburred using one of the many technologies available, larger components like castings have to be deburred manually or in recent times with assistance from robots. In fact, most of the present mass production systems aim towards automation and robotics for carrying out these operations. At present, substantial research effort is being spent towards robotic deburring. The major issue with robotic deburring is that the tool path gets affected in view of the interaction of cutting forces between the work piece and robot. The objective of present research is to carry out multidirectional investigations on robotic deburring using a SCARA robot, the application being confined mostly to the deburring of circular components. It is well known that SCARA (selective Compliant articulated Robot Arm) is a robotic manipulator with four degrees of freedom (3 rotary and 1 prismatic) and is preferred where speed, high precision and accuracy is required. In this work investigations on SCARA robot are carried out for different sized component which is positioned at different distances with respect to the base which leads to present a solution to component placement with in the workspace (solvability analysis) and also presents the placement position of a deburring component with minimum joint torques. A brief discussion on simulation of SCARA robot with force feedback control is presented, since this plays a major role in the maintenance of the path in the presence of varying cutting forces, and also presented kinematic and dynamic analysis of a SCARA robot for deburring of rectangular paths. The overall kinematic and dynamic analyses of the SCARA robot with different positional configurations of the workpieces in the workspace enables the energy to be computed for assessing the most desirable state for deburring which consumes the least energy. This data thus obtained enables a comparison and pseudo-optimize the best configuration for the entire deburring operation. Although the methodology is at present confined mostly to circular paths, similar analyses can be carried out for rectangular path deburring (similar to those on engine cylinder heads) and oblong and elliptical profiles which are commonly found in many engineering components.

	abstract = {Along with the development of advanced control system, in order to achieve the goal of low energy consumption, low pollution and high degree of automation, the coordination matching work of the motor driving electric motor car and the car body has a better future. By using GW48 hardware development platform and the SOPC technology of nuclear NiosII in FPGA as the central processing unit, and with the aid of the Avalon the peripheral circuit of the motor driving electric motor car is completely under control. This is a improvement of the classic control of the motor (i.e. based on single chip or DSP motor control). This article introduces the design method of the drive control system for electric motor cars. A function module design is conducted for the hardware part, which includes the PWM module and control module, and the PWM module and the VHDL language program is used to form the interface function module. A overall design discourse is conducted for the the software part, design processes of each function module are expounded in this paper. Finally the experimental results are given and they have been analysed. The experiment proves that the precision of SOPC technology in the application of electric motor drive control is high and the application is reasonable. It may become the trend of the development of the electric motor cars in the future. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Automation led to many innovations for a long time, most of them were developed during the twentieth century. It was commonly thought as a layer on top of a mechanical system. It promoted system management over low-level control. The more information technology evolves, the more it takes a fundamental part in our lives. This article describes a paradigm shift where automation will no longer be an add-on, and where software supports the definition, implementation and operationalization of functions and structures of products from the beginning of the design process. Any design today starts by using computer-aided design tools that enable us to easily draw, modify and fine-tune any kind of system. We can fully develop an airplane and literally fly it as a complex piece of software. Usability and usefulness can be tested before anything physical is built. Consequently, human-centered design (HCD) is now not only feasible but also can drive the overall engineering of products. We have started to design products from outside in, i.e.; from usages and purposes to means. We even can 3D print mechanical parts from the software-designed parts with ease. In human-computer interaction, specific research efforts are carried out on tangible objects, which define this inverted view of automation. We now design and develop by using information technology to do mechanical things, and therefore redefine the essence of a new kind of cognitive mechanical engineering. This article is about the revolution that is currently happening in engineering and industrial design due to the immersive influence of computers in our everyday life, and the expansion of HCD. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Given the important role of the collagenous structure in cartilage mechanics, there is considerable interest in the relationship between collagen crosslinking and the mechanical behavior of the cartilage matrix. While crosslink-induced alterations to the elastic modulus of cartilage have been described, changes to time-dependent behavior have not yet been determined. The objective of the study was to quantify changes to cartilage material properties, including viscoelastic coefficients, with crosslinking via indentation. To accomplish this, a semi-autonomous microindentation stress relaxation protocol was first developed, validated and then applied to cartilage specimens before and after crosslinking. The change in mechanical properties with crosslinking was analyzed both in the unloading portions of the test via the Oliver-Pharr method and in the holding portion with an inverse iterative finite element model that represented cartilage as a biphasic poroviscoelastic material. Although both techniques suggested a similar increase in equilibrium modulus in the crosslinked specimens as compared to the controls, distinct differences in the control specimens were apparent, suggesting that the two different techniques may be capturing different aspects of the material behavior. No differences in time-dependent properties were observed between the crosslinked and the control specimens. These results give further insight into the effects of crosslinking in cartilage mechanical behavior. Additionally, the microindentation stress relaxation protocol may enable increased automation for high-throughput testing. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

In order to improve its capability of autonomous navigation in an unknown, enormous and enclosed air-duct network, a low-cost robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) scheme is proposed. By combing an inertial measurement unit (IMU) with a stereo camera and fusing measurements of both sensors with the Rao-Blackwellized paticle filter, the proposed scheme can restrain drift of IMU, and provide fast dynamic full six-dimensional ego-motion information (including position, attitude and velocity) of the ADCR and reliable three-dimensional visual information inside the ventilation-duct. Furthermore, a bidirectional data association method based on the geometry compatibility and landmark's visual appearance is proposed to guarantee robustness of visual landmarks. The performance of the proposed scheme is proved to be effective with experiments. © 2013 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

The work was done within the scope of a Mechanical Engineering senior course that's objective was to introduce students to the processes of advanced manufacturing and to solving practical engineering problems in manufacturing automation. The students' efforts at integration covered automation of conceptual and geometric designs, automation of machining process, and machine sequence optimization. The CAD/CAM software, CAMM3 Micromodeler, G-code, NX8, Solid Works, DELMIA/QUEST, and Mastercam were used successfully in a sequence. A survey of the students' opinions about the effectiveness and user friendliness of the software was summarized at the end of the semester. The elements of the course were integrated in the Final Project. Full automation of integrated design and manufacturing data exchange were found to be too difficult to accomplish. However, the use of the automation software in a sequence, together with data export and import, marks a significant step forward towards integrated manufacturing automation. The research to accomplish this will continue and the results will be applied in order to reinforce the teaching and practice of Manufacturing Automation. Copyright © 2014 by ASME.},

	abstract = {The most desired disaster prevention in Taiwan has to be typhoon; therefore there is a saying "good weather, good life." The government does everything to prevent nature disaster, preparedness, response and recovery, especially on typhoon flooding survey. In order to conduct instant contingency handling disaster reaction in biggest disaster conditions, the government hopes to control the disaster immediately, and calculate the disaster loss. The main purpose of this study is to build a flood automation system. Apply auto-recording water level monitoring system (internal or external water) from water stations to collect stage data, and integrate Geographic Information System by the terrain grid computing, then obtain the instant scope of inundation and flood depth. Together with the instant rainfall and forecast to achieve the effectiveness of the flood watch or warning, then we should possibly control the instant information for the anticipation of the flood disaster. Taking it further with the Flood Security Plan, we have the best reference for decision-making use in the Emergency Response Center. The study area is located in Yilan County, the most sensitive flooded region, to set up immediate foregoing typhoon instant information system or so-called flood automation system, and then by several times of investigations and post-disaster flood scar volume measured we completely record ground hydrological information, and calibrate it with water level gauges built by Taiwan National Typhoon and Flood Research Center and AWRSIP weather telemetry information platform of synthetic aperture radar images on the flooded scope and depth. The concept of flood automation system is based on the fact that the occurrence and distribution of flood is not merely a product of chance, but the result of a combination of climatic, hydrologic, geologic, topographic and soil-forming factors that together form an integrated dynamic system, thus, through a combination of real-time rainfall forecast, flood recording, automation requirement, Geographic Information System, flood warning, instant data transmission and the internet, be setting up an ideal typhoon instant information system, which can become high accurate and be suitable for easy use of flooded areas, in order to achieve sustainable development in those areas. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

Instead, the main reason for the shortcomings in the subjects' UML models seems to be difficulties to 'translate' their mental model of the system into an UML model. In particular, structure modeling was quite difficult to handle. Lack of time also was a problem, but resulted primarily from starting with the rather complicated structure modeling part instead of the behavior modeling part. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Development platforms are automated software tools used to synthesize new designs. They are prevalent in the embedded system design domain, with applications ranging from integrated circuits, circuit boards, electro-mechanical controls, and entire networked systems. Historically, this has enabled rapid and error-free design of very complex embedded software and electronics hardware, even those that control mechanical systems such as aerospace and automotive controls through automation of the design process. The state of mechanical design automation has far less commercial adoption or industrial demonstration of development platforms in mechanical design. This paper elaborates on what challenges mechanical design automation faces to reach the level of design automation in the embeded systems domain. Given a design library approach, it is concluded that uncertainty management is a key issue for future research, including model uncertainty for mechanical design modeling. These issues are then contextualized using a case from the aerospace industy.},

	abstract = {The idle time which is part of the order fulfillment time is decided by the number of items in the zone; therefore the item assignment method affects the picking efficiency. Whereas previous studies only focus on the balance of number of kinds of items between different zones but not the number of items and the idle time in each zone. In this paper, an idle factor is proposed to measure the idle time exactly. The idle factor is proven to obey the same vary trend with the idle time, so the object of this problem can be simplified from minimizing idle time to minimizing idle factor. Based on this, the model of item assignment problem in synchronized zone automated order picking system is built. The model is a form of relaxation of parallel machine scheduling problem which had been proven to be NP-complete. To solve the model, a taboo search algorithm is proposed. The main idea of the algorithm is minimizing the greatest idle factor of zones with the 2-exchange algorithm. Finally, the simulation which applies the data collected from a tobacco distribution center is conducted to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. The result verifies the model and shows the algorithm can do a steady work to reduce idle time and the idle time can be reduced by 45.63% on average. This research proposed an approach to measure the idle time in synchronized zone automated order picking system. The approach can improve the picking efficiency significantly and can be seen as theoretical basis when optimizing the synchronized automated order picking systems. © Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

	abstract = {A newly developed measuring procedure uses vignetting to evaluate angles and angle changes, independently from the measurement distance. Further on, the same procedure enables the transmission of a digital readout and therefore a better automation of the electronic signal evaluation, for use as an alignment telescope. The fully extended readout by a simple 3-D reflector will provide the user with a measurement result with six degrees of freedom. The vignetting field stop procedure will be described. Firstly, considering artificial vignetting, the theoretical basics from geometric-optical view are represented. Secondly, the natural vignetting with photometric effects will be considered. The distribution of intensity in the image plane light spot, the so-called V-SPOT, is analytically deduced as a function of differently measured variables. Intensity shifts within the V-Spot are examined independently from different effects by numeric simulation. On these basics, the theoretical research regarding accuracy, linearity as well as results in 2 dimensional surface reconstruction on precision optical mirrors and also three dimensional measurements in mechanical engineering are examined. Effects and deviations will be discussed.

The study of standardized wireless networks for industrial applications is more based on the Zigbee research methods. In this paper, we try to increase the combining of these new design technology and industrial automation of wireless standards. Wireless based on the PC can be applied in the micro and macro industrial by using Zigbee network; it has a variety of different types of processors and microcontrollers. Microcontroller relates to the temperature sensor, the zero crossing detector and voltage regulatory agencies. The system can completely control them through visual-based GUI (graphical user interface of the PC). The graphical user interface is the applications program based on the user-developed. All processors and controllers are interconnected PC through Zigbee. The PC will continue to monitor all the data structure unit and compare value from remote processing preloaded process. If you find any error, computer will take the necessary action. Zigbee network is also the star topology structure that tries the four nodes. The first Zigbee is connected to the personal computer, it has fully functional device, its role is transmitting and receiving the data of other nodes. The second, third and fourth of the Zigbee have device that can reduce function, and they are used to control the rotational speed of the DC motor, have separate control of the temperature and the lamp lighting. It can interconnect all processing unit of Zigbee through the RS232 protocol. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the nature of engineering design has changed due to advances in embedded system design and computer technologies. It is rare to engineer a purely mechanical design that does not incorporate electrical and electronic components. Mechanical engineers and mechanical engineering technologists must possess a multi-disciplinary knowledge with the understanding of both mechanical and electrical systems. For this purpose, undergraduate programs in engineering technology have added mechatronics courses to their curriculum. Mechatronics is a design process that is multi-disciplinary in nature and integrates principles of many engineering disciplines including, but not limited to, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and controls engineering. These courses typically incorporate problem-based learning and project-based pedagogy to effectively build the student's knowledge and understanding. Old Dominion University's Mechanical Engineering Technology (ODU MET) program offers undergraduate courses related to Advanced Manufacturing including Robotics; Automation; Lean Manufacturing; Computer Integrated Manufacturing; and Advanced Manufacturing Processes. Recently, two new courses related to mechatronics were added to the same focus area. In addition, ODU MET program has placed an increased emphasis on mechatronics for students' senior design projects. This paper highlights the benefits of including mechatronics in the ODU MET curriculum and presents several recent senior design projects that showcase how the student has incorporated multi-disciplinary principles into the design and build of a functional mechatronic device. By embedding these experience into their senior design project, students are exposed to other engineering technology areas, learn the terminology of other professions, and feel more confident to join the workforce with the cross-disciplinary skills needed to be successful. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014.},

The initial application to repeatedly and automatically lift a mechanical cover or gate was presented as part of an undergraduate student project in the Mechanical Engineering Technology Program's Automation and Controls course in the Department of Engineering Technology at Old Dominion University. Valve operation, including self-latching, utilizes mechanical means only. The valve does not require any electrical power, electronic sensors, or controller, which makes it an energy-saving device. For light-duty operation, a bellows foot-air pump is used for air supply. A single activation of the pump's foot pedal opens the gate. The gate remains in the open position until the foot pedal is activated a second time. Additional design features include low component cost and increased operational safety. Future design improvements as well as potential applications for medium and heavy-duty operation are discussed. © 2013 American Society for Engineering Education. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Distribution network reconfiguration is one of the essential functions of the DMS system; it can be attributed to a number of constraints of large-scale nonlinear combinatorial optimization problem in mathematics. The characteristic of load change of time and space will affect the results of load forecasting. Distribution network reconfiguration relies on the load forecasting results. This paper proposes the more realistic distribution reconfiguration scheme based on the GIS system with space information through spatial data mining. For the real-time and efficiency of effective assurance data, the interface design in GIS system and distribution automation system are also proposed. The geographical information and real-time information are connected seamlessly, so that this two system information is highly unified. The solution can provide the data basis for distribution reconfiguration scheme accurately, and improve power supply reliability of distribution network. It shows that through the example: GIS based on the spatial data mining can provide load in quantity, time, space prediction for the deeper research of distribution network reconfiguration. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Activities in the field of automated driving have produced a variety of development tools and methodologies over the past decades. The requirements the systems have to fulfil and thus also the development guidelines are often documented in different kinds of catalogues (use-case catalogues, situation catalogues, scenario catalogues etc.). These catalogues cannot be directly applied for the development of partially and highly automated vehicle guidance concepts like conduct-by-wire (CbW) or H-mode. One reason is that up to now, no consistent terminology known to the authors yet exists for vehicle automation within the community. Moreover, as the aim of the two project groups CbW and H-mode is to make a comprehensive feasibility assessment of cooperative vehicle guidance, all interacting components of the overall system as well as all potential driving conditions a cooperative vehicle guidance system might have to cope with have to be analysed. This article focuses on two aspects. The first is a metaphor-based terminology discussion leading to a proposal for a fundamental ontology. The second aspect is an outlook on the different catalogues that use the new terminology and that have been developed. The methodology introduced here is a fundamental contribution towards simplifying communication and the exchange of findings. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014.},

	abstract = {Internet MIS security technology includes mainly: Authentication, Encryption, Access Control, Auditing and so on. Role-based access control (RBAC) is an access control method that has been widely used in Internet, operation system and relation database many years. Though RBAC is already relatively mature in the above fields, new problems occur when it is used in XML properties. By means of enterprise office automation system (EOA), the enterprise can easily migrate the release of information and communication functions to the Internet, which makes people convenience. The EOA system also provided a combination of enterprise management process reengineering, construction and optimization of the internal management information systems, decision support systems, and office automation systems. The system can get high level technical and advisory support for the management of enterprise information to fulfill the needs of specific business, affairs, and the conferences. This paper introduces EOA system strategy based on role-based access control (RBAC). The system centers in day-to-day office management service, achieves division of authority between different departments and staff through the introduction of data rights and function rights, so as to achieve the office management platform with the coordination of information, management, and service. This paper provides the method of realizing the work flow through RBAC management, the concept of authority is broken down to each operating procedures; realization of user operational procedures are reflected in the achievement of right-matching and right-series, office processes are standardized, the management level and quality are improved; the goal of improving office efficiency is achieved. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

When the manipulators cooperate with the human to transport the object, the manipulators should not only support the human but also avoid some obstacles around them. The manipulators avoid the obstacles by utilizing the kinematic redundancy of the manipulator. The virtual force generated by virtual impedance is used in avoiding action. The virtual impedance is set between the manipulators and the obstacles. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified through simulations. © 2013 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

Further this software can be used as universal platform for simulation of mechanisms with serial, parallel as well as hybrid kinematic structure. This flexibility can be considered as a main advantage of the software RoboSim. Its specific feature is that there are used two different methods for calculation of inverse kinematics: heuristic and vector method as well.

	abstract = {Engineering and Engineering Technology students need to learn how to innovate and embrace new technologies as they develop and progress through their careers. Accomplishing this challenge requires the undergraduate degree programs to provide the first opportunities for innovation technological problems to gain experience and confidence before they reach the Capstone course. This paper describes the learning experiences in innovation using undergraduate courses in Robotics and Automation, Finite Element Analysis, and Parametric Modeling and Rapid Prototyping. The courses are composed of Mechanical Engineering (ME) and Mechanical Engineering Technology (MET) students. The paper relates the successful attempts the students have had in developing and using innovation through the creation of openended projects in the three courses. The undergraduate students in each course are self-directed and have to use innovation to develop a project of their own design within the course restraints. This breaks the cycle of students just doing the same preset experiments that others have done before them. Although doing preset experiments can reinforce the theoretical concepts given in classroom, it does little to develop skills in innovation, which will be the key to success in the global economy. The courses used in ME and MET programs provide an excellent framework for the students to demonstrate their ability to innovate using new technology to solve a complex engineering problem. The project is also supervised by instructors as students take their first steps in actually doing innovation. The confidence and process used to solve these technical problems will provide a basis upon which they can formulate new strategies to incorporate new technologies throughout their career. Using this new approach will help our students gain confidence in reaching out to use new technologies and innovation early in their career. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014.},

In this context, the tuning of the controller implemented in the converter is made in order to assure the imposed speed of the motors and implicitly of the machines, respectively an appropriate speed evolution of the motors in the period of their acceleration and deceleration to assure the machines correct positioning. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

The evaluation of noise emitted by an object by measuring the acoustic intensity according with the ISO 9614-3:2002 international standard requires displacement of the probe on spatial trajectories with constant speed and maintaining the spatial orientation of the probe. In a previous work a robot was design by the authors for performing this task, including a unit with 3 translations and an orientation unit with 2 rotations.The practical tests of the first system shown high difficulties in maintaining the constant speed due to the robot dimensions and inertia. Also the noise produced by the translational units during scanning was too high. The system is improved by adding 1 degree of freedom at the orientation unit, reduction of noise and new software version. The new mechanical structure is the subject of another paper. This article is presenting the control system of the robot based on Festo controllers, DSP board and programs derived using LabVIEW. The new version is based on a positioning of the scanning unit in the vicinity of the scanning plane, using translation axis, and then the displacement of the acoustic probe for scanning using only the orientation unit, having DC motors, much lower inertia. This allowed a better control of scanning and lower noise. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

The international OPC standard has been used. There are three examples which have been briefly described. The first example uses PC - PLC peer to peer connection. The PC has a PROBIBUS physical connection to the PLC and acts as a PROFIBUS Master. The PC has another physical connection to the same PLC using an Ethernet cable. The software has implemented two parallel data exchange protocols using OPC Server and Libnodave library. The second sample describes a configuration which comprises two PC's and one PLC. A PC acts as a PROFIBUS master. It is physically connected both to the PLC on the PROFIBUS network and to the other PC (which acts as a client) using an Ethernet connection. A proprietary software protocol has been developed. The third sample describes the principles of connecting the PLC to the Internet using ISAPI technology to implement on the Web Server side.},

	abstract = {This paper describes in details the evaluation procedure developed in this paper for the measurement of the Kinect sensor's accuracy and robustness in the detection process of the user hand and recognizing human hand gestures. Furthermore, the results are transferred to a robotic gripper in virtual environment for 7visualization. The research started with consideration on the current state of the methods and sensors used for the detection of the hand gestures. It was seen that the detection of human hand and gestures recognition represent an important research study in the field of robotics controls and automation. Through the time, different methods and sensors were developed for the action of detection which became, with the passing of time, better and better, reaching today, a point, when Kinect sensor was constructed as a combination between mature sensor technology and efficient algorithms for detection. The goal of this paper is represented by the analysis, if the XBox 360 (TM) Kinect sensor, developed by Microsoft, is accurate enough to be used as a mean to control a robotic hand in virtual environment. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Systems Engineering (SE) is an approach for designing complex systems. It is now standardized, applied succesfully and recognized in industry. It is intrinsically a model based approach i.e. it promotes a set of modeling languages, reference models, methods, techniques, and processes allowing to guide and organize the designers work. Particularly, verification process is one of the main standardized processes. It helps the engineering team to detect errors or mistakes, to check solutions, to assume traceability of proof to the different stakeholders, and finally to help to argue and to assume the quality and relevance of the proposed solutions. The engineering team involved in a SE project is provided with various verification techniques and tools e.g. simulation, test, expertise, data analysis, traceabilty matrix, etc. However, the formal techniques used in other domains e.g. in software, automation or in mechanical engineering, remain not really considered to be an advantage in SE for many reasons which are first presented and analyzed in this paper. Second, it presents and illustrates the different components of a formal verification framework called UPSL-SE (Unified Properties Specification Language for Systems Engineering). This framework is based on a set of concepts, proposes verification techniques and is implemented in a platform allowing to complete the current verification toolbox. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, Brain network as a means of emerging brain disease research has been fully recognized which is applied to the neurological diseases, such as major depressive disorder (MDD). It also can detect the exception of the whole brain network topological. But there is no evidence to prove that abnormal brain network topology metrics can be an effective feature in the classification model to distinguish the healthy control and MDD. So, we hypothesize the abnormal brain network topology metrics can be used as an valid classification feature. Resting state functional brain networks were constructed for 26 healthy controls and 34 MDD patients by thresholding partial correlation matrices of 90 regions. According to the theory-based approaches, the global and local metrics were calculated. Non-parametric permutation tests were then used for group comparisons of topological metrics, which were used as classified features in support vector machine algorithm. The current study demonstrate that MDD is associated with abnormal function brain network topological metrics and statistically significance network metrics can be successfully used for feature selection in classification algorithms. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

In this way Acoustic Emission Technology (AET) is one of the earliest documented applications that has been developed to rotating machinery monitoring. Predictions of output parameters in journal bearing are function of operational parameters in test-rig. In this paper an experimental work which is set-up by different load and speed and three viscosity type of one oil has been used for hydrodynamic bearing. During the tests, acoustic emission output parameters (AE RMS, ABS energy) were obtained. Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Interface System (ANFIS) as an advanced statistical method has been applied to predict the relationship between input and output parameters. In this way, obtained data was trained and the precision of the predicted model was tested to find efficiency of the proposed method. The results show that this method can predict AE output parameters by 0.1% error. In this way the effectiveness, as well as the ability of the proposed method for data mining is evaluable.

	abstract = {An essential task in today's engineering is to realize a multifunctional design which needs an optimization process to achieve highest performance (load profile), minimized energy consumption (fuel, gas, electricity in production and life time of product) and maximized sustainability (during entire life cycle from idea to end of life) at an affordable prize in combination. Another point is that the performance of products is increased steadily up to now, which shifts the load profile towards higher peak loads. Consequently, a related design methodology is necessary which takes into account modern techniques of CAD (Computer Aided Design) and FEA (Finite Element Analysis) besides analytical engineering calculation and testing. Also the inclusion of nontechnical aspects must be possible (e.g. experience, rating of economy). Besides this the local stressing, time dependency and non-linear behavior must be considered in more detail; examples are proposed below. This methodology can be illustrated very well for the example of screw joints in products with high mechanical loading between components. Established technical literature mainly refers to pure technical aspects of bolted joints, e.g. [1, 2, 3]. Another important aspect for modern products is the increased use of mechatronic functions (mechanical system added by sensors, actuators and controller as well as controlling software). These functions raise the variety of failure modes significantly, which requires improved reliability. The paper describes, how screw joints are affected, because the number of screw joints increases and that engineers have to use reliable design methods to develop robust products. Looking to the packaging of mechatronic products, smaller screws joints are used because of space restrictions coming from the high number of components. In the end this means higher stressing of smaller screws. Countersunk heads offer benefits regarding space requirements, but need to consider positioning tolerances. For optimization process always non-linear relations are challenging; they need special description of the mechanisms and increase the demand for quality of the optimization method (e.g. convergence of numerical methods). Conclusions from this result in fastening perspectives for the design of innovative products for the future (automation of engineering design for fast product development considering complex interactions).

	abstract = {The fractional volume of the reservoir sand shall be taken to the ground when the crude oil is brought up from the ground. With the deepening of the oil extraction the sand content of oil recovery is increasing. Although many measures have been used such as prevent sand, block sand and so on, the viscosity of heavy oil is big and the fractional of sand is carried into the crude oil gathering system inevitably, causing a series of problems at ground equipment, having a serious impact on the normal production and gathering of crude oil. The larger size of sand can be removed by the sedimentation and the smaller sand can be removed by hydrocyclone devices. Hydrocyclone is a separation plant used to separate non-uniform phase mixtures. It can be used to complete the liquid clarification and to wash particles, liquid degassing and grit removal, grading and classification of solid particles and the separation of two non-miscible liquids and others. Hydrocyclone separation technique is simple and convenient operation, high separation efficiency, no rotating units, small size and easy to realize automatic control. On the offshore platform, if the sand mixed with oil is discharged into sea unsatisfactory the standard, it will pollute the sea. It will cause a serious of marine pollution; this is a problem that should be solved quickly. This paper discusses the requirements for the design of the hydrocyclone desander equipment with compact structure, applicable to offshore drilling platforms, and carrying out CFD simulation, the results showing that the particle size of 75 of sand, grit removal efficiency above 90%. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.},

This is especially true for the education component of the manufacturing and design curriculums. Some reading and stylized laboratory and group projects often substitute for real experience. In this paper an innovative experiential learning curriculum called Virtual Learning Factory (V-Learn- Fact) is described for teaching manufacturing and design courses. In the V-Learn-Fact curriculum, the entire class takes part in a single large project, which covers product realization from concept to final production stage. V-Learn-Fact was implemented in MAE464/564 - Manufacturing Automation course (senior elective and graduate level course) between 2006-2012. A student survey was carried out to gauge effectiveness of this curriculum. 89% of the students fully or partially agreed that the V-Learn-Fact helped them learn topics in manufacturing automation better than traditional mechanical engineering courses. Written comments also provided interesting insights. Copyright © 2013 by ASME.},

	abstract = {We propose an accurate and precise method for measuring the Young's modulus of MEMS with comb drives by electronic probing of capacitance. The electronic measurement can be performed off-chip for quality control or on-chip after packaging for self-calibration. Young's modulus is an important material property that affects the static or dynamic performance of MEMS. Electrically-probed measurements of Young's modulus may also be useful for industrial scale automation. Conventional methods for measuring Young's modulus include analyzing stress-strain curves, which is typically destructive, or include analyzing a large array of test structures of varying dimensions, which requires a large amount of chip real estate. Our method measures Young's modulus by uniquely eliminating unknowns and extracting the fabricated geometry, displacement, comb drive force, and stiffness. Since Young's modulus is related to geometry and stiffness that we find using electronic measurands, we are able to express Young's modulus as a function of electronic measurands. We verify our method by using it to predict the Young's modulus of a computer model. We treat the computer model as we would treat a true experiment by depending only on its electronic measurands. We find good agreement in predicting the exactly known Young's modulus in a computer model within 0.1%. Copyright © 2012 by ASME.},

The deviations of desired positions and actual positions are estimated for specific objective task. Further, effect of these error sources is modelled with a higher-DoF mechanism which is kinematically better than single-DoF mechanisms. Two-DoF mechanism is modelled for identical objective task. Maximum positional deviations are estimated for two-DoF mechanism. The comparative analysis of deviation is obtained.

Thereby the transmission topology as well as the operation and drive strategy and their independencies have a great influence on the comfort and the energy efficiency of the vehicle. Especially in modern drivelines, like in hybrid electric vehicles there are great independencies between those factors, which have to be considered and integrated in order to achieve a global optimum. In this contribution an integrated validation and development environment with the focus on hybrid transmission applications is presented. This approach is capable to integrate and consider aspects of complex powertrain systems, as hybrid powertrains, and to cover the competing aspects of NVH, drivability as well as energy efficiency. The approach is an integral combination of new or already published as well as established individual methods that have been extended with challenging aspects of hybrid powertrain development. One integrated method is the time-efficient arrangement of measuring points in order to shorten the global needed conditioning phases. For gearshift evaluation of a dual clutch transmission, this reduces operation time on the roller test bench about 80% compared to an experienced test driver [1]. The integrated approach uses system identification to create time and cost efficient test runs for the test based optimization [2]. Thereby advanced methods for rating the drivability and for automatic identification of NVH-Phenomena [3] are used to optimize multi criteria objective functions. The measurement is done in the IPEK-Xin- The-Loop Framework (XiL) [4], which enables a transmission assessment on the complete vehicle level. Copyright © 2013 by ASME.},

The system includes three parts which are box rotation system, poster scrolling system and single-axis sun tracking system which can improve the solar energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption. Sun tracking system which effectively combined the sun angle tracking and photoelectric tracking method can automatically switch between the work mode and hibernate mode according to time and weather condition so as to maximize energy efficiency. A hierarchical control strategy which contained main control system and sun tracking system is adopted to control light box rotation, panel displaying and sun tracking at the same time. The solar advertising light box system was verified by tests that with the hierarchical control strategy the power generated by solar panel increased 38.2% than fixed panel.

	abstract = {The process of generating the most attractive product concepts in engineering design is still one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. There are several tools for supporting this extremely uncontrollable phase of engineering design. Except for the method, the problem-solving software is the very important tool. One of the most useful methods in teaching and learning, i.e. Brief Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (BTIPS), is discussed in other papers [1], [2], [3] and [4]. This paper is devoted to the software supporting the problem solving process. There is still no software suitable for a completely satisfactory automation of the conceptual design process. However there are some software packages that could be the most helpful in supporting the process and would greatly influence the quality of the final product, especially in cases of contradicting constraints. In this paper some results of the research on the use and effectiveness of Invention Machine (IMTM) software products are described. Four packages are discussed and compared: the IM v. 2 for Windows, TechOptimizer v. 3.5, TechOptimizer v. 4.0 and Goldfire v. 6.5. Goldfire v. 6.5 evaluation is still in the process and is not completely finished yet. The first three packages were used in teaching several junior, senior and graduate courses at the University of Connecticut (UConn) for many years. The experience with Goldfire v. 6.5 is comparatively limited. In the research described in this paper the content and the teaching effectiveness of the software packages in teaching were studied. Data from student feedback was evaluated, conclusions were derived. On the basis of this - recommendations for the future use of the software are offered. This paper concentrates on some instrumental software qualities that could be used in teaching of solving problems of industrial products conceptual design. The user's experience and its connection with the effectiveness of the packages used are discussed in the paper. Conclusions are derived at the end. Copyright © 2012 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Industrial dual-Arm robots have been gaining attention as novel tools in the field of new automation. Our past research has focused on using them flexibly to control both the linear and rotational motions of a working plate. However, it has been difficult to measure the synchronous accuracy of two rotary axes without a high-Accuracy gyro sensor. We therefore developed a novel method to measure the synchronous accuracy of the two rotary axes of a working plate with a ball, in which the ball is kept rolling around a circular path by dualarm cooperative control. In the present report, in order to widen the range of application, we tried to keep the ball rolling around a rhomboid path, which is one of the polygonal paths used on a working plate by dual-Arm cooperative control. It could be seen that there is some possibility of generating an equal speed diamond motion by inputting wave as the odd power of a trigonometric function and considered a deceleration angle with the robot that we handled.

Typically, we calculate load sheds during DR events by comparing observed electric load against counterfactual predictions made using statistical baseline models. Many baseline models exist and these models can produce different shed estimates. Moreover, modelers implementing the same baseline model can make different modeling implementation choices, which may affect shed estimates. In this work, using real data, we analyze the effect of different modeling implementation choices on shed estimates. We focus on five issues: weather data source, resolution of data, methods for determining when buildings are occupied, methods for aligning building data with temperature data, and methods for power outage filtering. Results indicate sensitivity to the weather data source and data filtration methods as well as an immediate potential for automation of methods to choose building occupied modes.

The structure of the growth system and its working principle are introduced in detail, and its components, software and hardware designing are given in the paper. In order to improve atomization efficiency of nutrient solution for uniform nutriment absorption at the root system, the ultrasonic atomizer, which can atomize the nutrient solution to the ultrafine particles of 1-5 microns diameter, is employed as the key component of system. Considering the effects of temperature and humidity on plant root growth, a digital temperature-humidity sensor is used to detect the environmental signal of the plant root system. The temperature and humidity information can be transmitted to MCU which automatically controls the actuators to adjust the temperature and humidity of nutrient mist in a expected range. The system with features of simple structure and convenient control can supply a experimental platform which is not only comfortable for aeroponics culture, but also convenient for morphologic observation of plant roots. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Microfluidic technologies hold a great deal of promise in advancing the medical field, but transitioning them from research to commercial production has proven problematic. We propose precision hot embossing as a process to produce high volumes of devices with low capital cost and a high degree of flexibility. Hot embossing has not been widely applied to precision forming of hard polymers at viable production rates. To this end we have developed experimental equipment capable of maintaining the necessary precision in forming parameters while minimizing cycle time. In addition, since equipment precision alone does not guarantee consistent product quality, our work also focuses on real-time sensing and diagnosis of the process. This paper covers both the basic details for a novel embossing machine, and the utilization of the force and displacement data acquired during the embossing cycle to diagnose the state of the material and process. The precision necessary in both the forming machine and the instrumentation will be covered in detail. It will be shown that variation in the material properties (e.g. thickness, glass transition temperature) as well as the degree of bulk deformation of the substrate can be detected from these measurements. If these data are correlated with subsequent downstream functional tests, a total measure of quality may be determined and used to apply closed-loop cycle-to-cycle control to the entire process. By incorporating automation and specialized precision equipment into a tabletop "microfactory" setting, we aim to demonstrate a high degree of process control and disturbance rejection for the process of hot embossing as applied at the micron scale.

	abstract = {For traditional adsorption cooling systems using silica-gellike desiccant wheels, the moisture is removed from the air and stored in the desiccant wheels. The subsequent reactivation process is to dry the wheel by blowing hot air. The moisture is added to the dried air to take the advantage of evaporative cooling. Currently, the two processes are performed on the different sections of a wheel. However, the temperature of the reactivated part will be higher, and the residual heat will be dissipated into the air-conditioning space. Some researchers have reported to add another section to cool down the regenerative part. Unfortunately, the addition of cooling section decreases the working durations of other two sections. In this study, a novel desiccant-evaporative cooling process is proposed. The wheel is now stationary. Fans and air doors were designed to adjust various air flows to pass through the wheel to perform the dehumidifying, reactivation, and cooling inside the wheel. Most importantly, for each period, the desiccant wheel was used only to dehumidify, reactivate, or cool down. The air to cool the desiccant wheel was released outside, so no residual heat went to the air-conditioning space. The outdoor air was acquired to be heated and reactivate the desiccant wheel. The indoor was used to cool the wheel to achieve better cooling effects. An experimental prototype was designed and established. The air could be directed through the desiccant wheel. A controller was installed. The duration of the dehumidifying, reactivation, and cooling process could be set on the panel. The evaporative cooling process was performed by ten ultrasonic humidifiers. The hot air was from a liquid-to-air heat exchanger, and the hot water can be from a solar heater or any waste heat sources. Optimized sets of period durations were suggested. The criteria to end each process have been proposed for future automation. It is shown that the novel design is able to deliver cooler air. Although the cool air output is currently intermittent, a solution has been figured out and will be improved soon. Copyright © 2013 by ASME.},

The optimum process parameters such as speed, feed and depth of cut for individual operations are calculated using this technique. The effect of change in design data on manufacturing parameters and eventually the cost of the crankshaft at each operation are visualized.

Using the edge distance determination technology to measure and compensate the deviation in time is one effective method to solve this problem. In the dissertation, after the characteristic of the edge distance determination technology is introduced, the working principle of the edge distance tracer apparatus is developed. Based on the mechanical design solution, a pressure sensor is selected to measure the position relationship between the riveting head and the stringer. Then an edge distance tracer apparatus is struck out to detect the deviation, which is an automatic positioning feedback device that can be fit for many kinds of stringers. And the riveting head is operated to meet the design deviation requirements. By using this technology, the drilling precision of the automated riveting system can be effectively improved. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Computer-aided design (CAD) consists of using computer systems to assist the creation, modification, analysis, and optimization of a design. Initial developments were carried out in the 1960s, linked to the aeronautic and automotive industries, although it was not until the 1980s that these tools started to be used in small and midsize companies, thus reducing the need of draftsmen. Initially designs attainable with CAD tools were mainly 2D, but nowadays the use of 3D modeling packages is widespread, due to its versatility. Nowadays it has become an essential set of tools with relevant benefits for any kind of industrial product development process, such as overall project cost and time optimization, what becomes especially relevant in the field of novel medical devices. Application fields include architecture, automotion, aeronautics, naval and mechanical engineering, automation and electrical engineering, chemical engineering and materials science, and especially linked to the purpose of this handbook, biomedical engineering. The promotion of information exchange among clients, developers, and suppliers, during a whole new product development process, is also noteworthy. CAD is intimately connected to several additional technologies, most of them working on the basis of an initial computer-aided designed part or product, such as computer-aided engineering (CAE), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), product data management (PDM), among others, all of them integrating the more general term of product lifecycle management (PLM) technologies. This chapter supplies an introduction to computer-aided design and its most typical resources, details relevant connections with other computer-assisted tools, andprovides different case studies linked to the development of real biodevices by using different simple CAD operations. Some current limitations and future trends, which will be discussed in following chapters, are also introduced. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2013.},

	abstract = {This paper is focused on developing numerical modeling techniques aimed at automating and simplifying the process of generating detailed models for simulating building thermal physics. However, the methodology described can be applied in numerous application areas across the thermals sector. Automated approaches to developing energy models for buildings are of particular importance to alleviate current labor intensive practices of manual generation so that large real-estate portfolios can be analyzed within a reasonable time frame, hence providing a decision making tool that can lead to smarter renovation plans for implementation across the fleet. This process is achieved by developing custom built software code in MathWorks MATLAB® with all aspects discussed herein. The starting point in this analysis is a series of individual CAD drawings for each building in the fleet with spatial coordinates for all lines and nodes loaded into matrices within MATLAB®. A constrained Delaunay triangulation technique is then applied to automatically differentiate building fabric components such as walls, columns, windows, etc., their physical scale, and all interior zones within the building. Multiple floor plans are also automatically linked by layer information, and a series of logical steps are then followed to identify zone-to-zone interactions and exterior building fabrics. A number of generic thermal resistance/capacitance models capable of modeling the anticipated thermal responses of all building elements are defined. These are assigned to the appropriate elements of the building fabric and linked based on the aforementioned zone identification process. The overall result of this process is the automated generation of a thermal energy model for any specific building that is capable of accurately modeling its thermal physics. However, property information specifically relating to on-premise building elements is not automatically discernible from these CAD-based models. In order to address this deficit, typical material properties are assumed for each element of the building fabric in the first instance, and an inverse heat transfer approach is implemented based on a set of limited sensor data for the building in question. This process results in optimizing estimated parameters so that predicted thermal physics match that of measured sensor data. Overall, the paper describes the development of this automated procedure, presents indicative results of its application, and discusses some possible limitations as well as guidelines aimed at alleviating some of these limitations. © 2013 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Microfluidic devices or lab-on-a-chip systems can make a significant impact in many fields where obtaining a rapid response is critical, particularly in analyses involving biological cells. Microfluidics has revolutionized the manner in which many different assessments/processes are carried out, since it offers attractive advantages over traditional bench-scale techniques. Some of the advantages are: small sample and reagent amounts, higher resolution and sensitivity, improved level of integration and automation, lower cost and much shorter processing times. There is a growing interest on the development of techniques that can be used in microfluidics devices. Among these, electrokinetic techniques have shown great potential due to their flexibility. Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is an electrokinetic mechanism that refers to the interaction of a dielectric particle with a spatially non-uniform electric field; this leads to particle movement due to polarization effects. DEP offers great potential since it can be carried out employing DC and AC electric fields, and neutral and charged particles can be manipulated. This work is focused on the use of insulator based DEP (iDEP), a novel dielectrophoretic mode that employs arrays of insulating structures to generate dielectrophoretic forces. Successful microparticle manipulation can be achieved employing iDEP, due to its unique characteristics that allow for great flexibility. In this work, microchannels containing arrays of cylindrical insulating posts were employed to concentrate, sort and separate microparticles. Mathematical modeling withCOMSOL® was performed to identify optimal device configuration. Different sets of experiments were carried out employing DC and AC potentials. The results demonstrated that effective and fast particle manipulation is possible by fine tuning dielectrophoretic force and electroosmotic flow. Copyright © 2013 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Molecular combing is an established technique for aligning DNA nanowires on a surface. When performed on micro-patterned surfaces, this technique can be used to reliably align and stretch DNA nanowires across micro pillars. Imprinting of these aligned DNA nanowires is an affordable technique for fabrication of arrays of nano-scale channels across micro-scale reservoirs. In the past, DNA combing and imprinting (DCI) have been performed manually to fabricate polymer chips that are used in biomedical applications such as gene therapy and drug delivery studies. Automation of the DCI process is necessary to improve the yield and to scale-up production for these applications. However, existing automated techniques are not appropriate for DNA nano wire imprinting because these techniques cannot handle (i) fragile stamps and (ii) individual chip scale stamps of size ∼1 cm2. Herein, we present the design, fabrication and performance evaluation of an imprinting stage that enables (i) handling fragile stamps via low-cost equipment and (ii) production scale-up via simultaneous handling of multiple stamps. The stage is based on a self-aligning imprinting technique that passively aligns a stamp parallel to the substrate thereby enabling simultaneous imprinting of multiple stamps via a single stage. This self-alignment technique minimizes nano wire breakage by ensuring (i) minimal in-plane stamp motion during imprinting and (ii) that the contact forces do not exceed the weight of the stamp. Based on this technique we have designed/fabricated a stage that can simultaneously handle three stamps and is capable of further scale-up. The stage consists of a movable platform that is mounted on linear bearings and is actuated via a stepper motor. Stamps are loaded onto a holder that is mounted on the movable platform via kinematic couplings. This allows one to rapidly attach and detach the holder from the stage and also makes it possible to handle fragile stamps during loading/unloading. Imprinting of DNA nanowires with a manual stage has demonstrated the feasibility of the self-alignment scheme. Experiments that were performed to test the alignment capability of the stage verify that conformal stamp contact can be achieved across all three stamps even in the presence of an angular misalignment of 5obetween the stamp and the glass slide. This ability to simultaneously align multiple stamps is a critical step in being able to scale-up and fully automate the DCI process. Copyright © 2012 by ASME.},

Typically, we calculate load sheds during DR events by comparing observed electric demand against counterfactual predictions made using statistical baseline models. Many baseline models exist and these models can produce different shed calculations. Moreover, modelers implementing the same baseline model can make different modeling implementation choices, which may affect shed estimates. In this work, using real data, we analyze the effect of different modeling implementation choices on shed predictions. We focused on five issues: weather data source, resolution of data, methods for determining when buildings are occupied, methods for aligning building data with temperature data, and methods for power outage filtering. Results indicate sensitivity to the weather data source and data filtration methods as well as an immediate potential for automation of methods to choose building occupied modes.

	abstract = {Discontinuous tape winding, which has obvious advantages in large extension ratio winding, is widely used in the molding of composites. Therefore, the research on technological parameters becomes the focus of many scholars. However, how to accomplish the variable tension control is usually not fully considered. Accordingly, the constant extension ratio and the smoothness of winding process cannot be ensured. Aiming at the problem of tension control, this paper first gives a comparatively deep research on the control method and the interaction mechanism of tension, extension ratio, automatic lap and automatic rectification. Then, according to the winding process features, the mechanical device and the mathematical model of tension control system are established respectively. With regard to the characteristics of PID controller and fuzzy controller, the fuzzy self-tuning PID controller is designed. As a result, the variable tension control is realized during the winding and lapping process, and the constant extension ratio is guaranteed. Finally, a sample application is presented for demonstration. By presenting the variable tension control techniques for discontinuous tape winding, the constant extension ratio of tapes is achieved, the consecution and the automation degree of winding process is improved as well. Thus, the quality of wound products is guaranteed. © Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

	abstract = {The MAGDRIVE project, granted by the Space program of the EU-FP7, is developing a gear able to produce reduction ratios from 1 to several hundreds by means of magnetic teeth. The teeth, unlike the conventional gears, do not touch one to other. This makes that this gear does not need any kind of lubrication. In case that the maximum torque is passed over the axle simply clutches, but nothing breaks down. Therefore, it has an intrinsic antijamming characteristic. It is also reversible: it can reduce but also multiply the velocity. It can also go clockwise or anticlockwise. Ratio, maximum torque, stiffness and damping can be customized. Even more it can also be customized to be direct or inverted (inverting the sense of the rotation). A low noise level is also a remarkable feature of this kind of device. These characteristics make this technology very attractive for a number of different fields like aerospace, automation, automotive and others. Two different prototypes have been developed: the first one is a "room-temperature prototype" for working temperature from -40°C to 100°C, while the second one is a "cryogenic prototype" that can work at temperature as low as 70 K. The results of the tests for the first prototype are shown in this work. Copyright © 2013 by ASME.},

	abstract = {The adjacent relation of mechanism kinematic chain is represented by a primary adjacency matrix by using primes to mark its components. An isomorphism identification matrix results from the primary adjacency matrix and prime products representing secondary adjacent relation, and uses its determinant and solution vector of linear equation system to identify mechanism isomorphism. Dynamically, the identification matrix is modified by new primes on the basis of the classification of solution vector elements. The result generates a solution vector with independent elements, which determines the positions of all nodes in the topological graph of a kinematic chain. Furthermore, a mapping relation, which results in a necessary and sufficient condition for isomorphism, is established between componential codes of two isomorphic mechanisms. As a result, this new identification method utilizes varying primes to virtually destruct the symmetry of the topological graph and change local and secondary adjacency relations among nodes under unchanged topological structure. Then, this method is also available for isomorphism identification of general undirected graphs. Applied examples show that it is very effective and reliable for automatic identification with code mapping of isomorphism mechanisms and polynomial algorithm for computation time. © 2013 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

	abstract = {The economical production of high-value, low-volume, machined components is an important subtopic of advanced manufacturing. Bar feeders, a well-established technology for adding a high degree of automation to CNC turning centers by feeding 12′ lengths of stock through the machine spindle, have limitations in this realm. They rely on supporting the entire length of the stock in a continuous fluid bearing in order to suppress potential vibrations. Although this results in excellent vibration suppression, long tooling changeovers make them impractical for small batch sizes. Additionally, the expense of the tooling can render them cost-prohibitive. Thus a bar feeder technology is desired that provides comparable vibration suppression for a wide variety of stock sizes without the need for size-specific tooling changes. In this, a movable point support having tunable viscoelastic properties is studied for controlling the vibration of varying lengths of bar stock in a given speed range. The transverse vibration of mounted bar stock is modeled as a Bernoulli-Euler beam. The effects of the support position, viscoelastic model, and their associated parameters on the resonant frequencies, damping ratios, and vibration response of the bar stock are studied. Such a study will be instrumental in developing passive/active vibration control strategies for future bar feeders. Copyright © 2013 by ASME.},

In this paper, we describe how automation can not only greatly reduce the cost of education, but also create new learning paradigms that can increase the effectiveness of that education as compared to traditional classroom learning. Intelligent Tutoring Massively Open Online Courses (ITMOOCs) can seamlessly deliver entire curricula while ensuring that students achieve and maintain the required level of proficiency in every curriculum topic. This is achieved by organizing the curriculum into an ontology of interconnected topic nodes, and assessing the students' performance after he/she covers every node. The Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) continuously adapts the course's delivery to the needs of each student by skipping over topics that the student demonstrates proficiency in, and reviewing topics that are determined to be the cause of assessment failures in downstream course nodes. The ITS can also ensure that students maintain the required level of proficiency in the topics they have learned throughout their educational and professional careers by assigning an expiration time to each curriculum node after which it is reassessed. The system allows each student to set unique educational goals by selecting the individual topics that he/she ultimately wants to learn. Copyright © 2013 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Mechatronics is the integration of different sciences and techniques of mechanical engineering, automatic control, electronics, and informatics. The rapid evolution of the market competitors requires the reduction of development time of a product while increasing the quality and performance. It is, therefore, necessary to increase the efficiency of the design process. To meet this need, simulation and, especially, virtual prototyping have become a key technology. It is difficult to find simulation tools are able to analyze multidependent systems of different areas. However, an environment that allows a simulation integrating multidisciplinary mechatronic systems is necessary. This paper describes a method of design and simulation of mechatronic systems. First, we identify the behavior model and its associated 3D geometric model. The behavior model is seen as a dynamic hybrid system of two coupled hybrid automata (operative part and control part). Then, we present OpenMASK and OpenModelica simulators, the IEEE1516 standard HLA and work related to this distributed architecture for simulation. In a top-down approach, we present our method and experiments to integrate HLA functionalities in these simulators and to distribute the modeling elements of mechatronic systems. Also, we propose extensions to integrate real-time for interactive simulations. Finally, we apply our approach on a representative example of a mechatronic system. © 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

	abstract = {An Automated Manual Transmission (AMT) is directly derived from a manual one through the integration of actuators; then, development and production costs are generally lower than other automatic transmissions, while the reliability and durability are at highest level. For high class sport cars, vehicle dynamic performances and driving quality can be strongly improved with respect to automatic transmissions [1]. AMTs systems are generally constituted by a dry or wet clutch assembly and a multi-speed gearbox, both equipped with electro-mechanical or electro-hydraulic actuators, which are driven by a control unit, the transmission control unit (TCU). The operating modes of AMTs are usually two: semiautomatic or fully automatic. In both cases, after the gear shift command, the TCU manages the shifting steps according to current engine regime, driving conditions and selected program. In this transmission type the quality of the vehicle propulsion as perceived by the driver is largely dependent on the quality of the control strategies. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses on control schemes for AMTs have shown that uncertainties in clutch torque characteristic can severely affect the performance of the clutch engagement: modeling in detail the torque transmitted by the specific clutch architecture is a crucial issue in order to design robust engagement control strategies [2, 3 and 4]. This paper aims at investigating the engagement performance of an actuated dry clutch by taking into account the inference of the pressure on the facing materials and the sliding speed. In fact, according to literature outcomes [5], the friction coefficient after a first rising behavior with the sliding speed shows an asymptotic value for a typical clutch facing; the same material exhibits a nearly linear dependence of the friction coefficient on the pressure. The simulations consider: reduced-order dynamic system for simulation of passenger car driveline, control algorithm, experimental maps of the n-D clutch transmission characteristic, and gear shift maneuvers in different operating conditions. The outcome of this analysis could provide valuable issues for designers of automated clutches and control engineers to overcome the well known poor engagement performances of open loop motion strategy of the throwout bearing where cost reason and complexity don't permit the use of displacement sensor.

	abstract = {The mechanical engineering department at Washington State University has just completed a 6 year program in offering a modern sequence of design/manufacturing electives. Using theoretical foundations, site visits, guest lectures, IT based labs, and hands-on manufacturing exercises students learn about the role of information technology and electronic data in modern manufacturing enterprise systems, design for manufacture concepts, design automation, and also hands-on machining using advanced programming concepts of CNC code and CNC machines that are integrated with CAD/CAM systems. In this paper, two key courses of this sequence will be discussed and the innovations that they have enabled in engineering design education of the students will be presented. What is significant is that thru these courses we have achieved a dynamic interplay between the new and the old - we have been able to leapfrog into concepts of modern industry where IT and modern computing tools play a critical role in the manufacturing enterprise system and bring about considerable design and manufacturing automation; at the same time we have also retained and enhanced traditional concepts from before where design engineers had considerable hands-on knowledge with machining and manufacturing processes.

It draws on many disciplines, including physics, mathematics, material science, biophysics and human behavioural, environmental and computational sciences. The discipline itself is continuously evolving and maturing, and improvements in model robustness and fidelity are constantly being made. This has sparked a new agenda focusing on the effectiveness of simulation in building life-cycle processes.; Produced in cooperation with the International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA), and featuring contributions from fourteen internationally recognised experts in this field, this book provides a unique and comprehensive overview of building performance simulation for the complete building life-cycle from conception to demolition.

	abstract = {In a scenario of a small and customized production of Electric Vehicles, it is important to have methodologies and tools able to guarantee high flexibility, good quality, and reduced time to market. The optimisation of electric motors and battery design stages is a key factor to achieve the expected results. Specific activities such as design automation, virtual prototyping and simulation are fundamental to obtain highperformance customised solutions. In this context the study of cooling systems for Li-Ion battery packs is one of the most important problems regarding EV and PHEV powertrain design. The proposed research presents a Knowledge Based methodology to support the cooling design of a battery pack and an analytical tool to evaluate the temperature and heat generation due to electrochemical reactions. All the research project is finalized to a definition of a Knowledge Based System to define a battery layout including engineering knowledge. The current strategies of battery pack design depend on the market size. In particular, the research activity is focalized on customized production of a SME (Small Medium Enterprise). The main question concerns the estimation of heat generated from electrochemical reactions in a single battery cell. In order to achieve these objectives, a preliminary phase for knowledge acquisition is necessary and a process of formalization has been carried out using the Knowledge Management methods. A first prototype of the Knowledge Based Engineering tool has been developed to determine the optimal cooling condition of a battery pack. The main module is based on an analytical approach which has been formulated to evaluate the average thermal flow generated by a standard LiFePO4 polymeric cell at different values of current and state of charge (SOC). This method can be used for different types of geometry and different chemical compositions. Finally, the proposed approach has been validated by experimental measures and numerical simulations in collaboration with a medium enterprise of electric energy storage systems and light ecological vehicles.

Based on the summary and analysis of the recent advances on welding?science and technology?in China, the future?development strategies on the relative fields are proposed. Due to steels still hold the dominant role in the basic structural materials, the study of welding metallurgy for the new generation steels and the development of high grade welding consumables are the key topics in welding manufacturing. China is now the largest electronic production site in the world, however, the study and development in lead-free soldering materials and lead-free packing technologies are the sole way to ensure China to be the largest green electronic producer. High energy density welding, such as laser beam welding and electron beam welding, is proven an advanced welding process which could increase the welding productivity remarkably, the study and application of such welding process in equipment manufacturing should be encouraged. The numerical simulation on welding process is beneficial in the understanding of the complex physical phenomena involved in welding, which also provides important and practical basic data. Significant progress in the simulation of thermal process, residual stress, deformation and welding metallurgy is made in China in the past years, nevertheless, the practical application of the above achievements should be further investigated. Achievements in research on automatic welding and intelligent welding have shown that the high productivity and welding quality could be reached by using welding automation, however, the integrated application of welding automation should be studied. The research and application on evaluation of integrity of welded structures should be emphasized in order to ensure fitness for purpose of such structures. © 2012 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

	abstract = {Many mechanical engineering programs around the country have mechatronics courses in their curricula. Over the past decade the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) community has made significant advances in developing educational materials and laboratory exercises in mechatronics. However, there is a gap remaining in the curricula. Academic programs are heavily oriented towards control theory, board-level electronics, interfacing and microprocessors supplemented with laboratory equipment, such as the inverted pendulum and LEGO robots. But industrial applications require mechanical engineers to design machines with multiple axes that execute complex, high speed, high precision coordinated motion using sophisticated motion controllers. In this paper, we present an overview of a new modular curriculum we are designing by partnering with industry to "teach the fundamentals", but in the context of industrial motion control technology and multi-axis machines. We also provide details of one of its modules along with assessment results and feedback from students. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education.},

The research on decoupled vibratory feeder concentrates on the modeling, the control system and structural optimization. The aim of this work is to focus on the integrated modeling of the decoupled vibratory feeder. The integrated modeling consists of the mechanic modeling, the electrical modeling and the control strategy. The modeling of all modules including the PID control, the power amplifier, the electromagnet, the feeder, the part motion and the feedback are discussed to reveal the relation between the input signal and the part motion. The block diagram of the integrated modeling of the whole system programmed with MATLAB is given in this paper.

Although manufacturing optimization tools can be considered mainstream technology, most U.S. manufacturers do not take full advantage of such technology because of the time-intensive procedures required to manually develop models, deal with factory data acquisition problems, and resolve the incompatibility of factory and optimization data representations. Therefore, automated data acquisition, automated generation of production models, and the automated integration of data into the production models are required for any optimization analysis to be timely and cost effective. In this paper, we develop a system methodology and software framework for the optimization of production systems in a more efficient manner towards the goal of fully automated optimization. The case study of an automotive casting operation shows that a highly integrated approach enables the modeling and simulation of the complex casting operation in a responsive, cost-effective and exacting nature. Technology gaps and interim strategies will be discussed. Copyright © 2013 by ASME.},

The syntheses of each finger is obtained via Freudenstein's methodology, assuming that the links lengths are constant, an fixed to a main link, and the pivot of the system is the knuckle. The only variable which may modify the displacement behavior of the system is the coupler, for each four-bar mechanism, therefore its length is directly related to the position of the finger. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Most air handling units (AHUs) in commercial buildings have an air economizer cycle for free cooling under certain outside air conditions. During the economizer cycle, the outside air and return air dampers are modulated to seek supply air temperature at its setpoint. The supply air temperature is typically set at 13 °C (55 °F) to control humidity in the space. However, dehumidification is not necessary when the outside air is dry. Meanwhile, the space may have less cooling load due to envelope heat loss and/or occupant schedule changes. These facts provide an opportunity to use higher supply air temperature to reduce or eliminate mechanical cooling and terminal box reheat. On the other hand, a higher supply air temperature requires increased air flow as well as fan power. Therefore, an optimization question was formed, through which an optimal supply air temperature is identified to minimize total energy consumption. In our previous studies, through simulation, 90% of energy savings were concluded and a universal control sequence was also proposed for implementing the optimal control strategy. In this paper, experiments were conducted to validate the previously documented theory concerning the optimal supply air temperature reset. The previously recommended universal control sequence is implemented into the building automation system for an airhandling unit control to make the program ready for the next step of verifying energy savings previously simulated. This paper presents optimization control system setup and experimental results showing the program tuning procedures, through which the program is ready for the next step. Copyright © 2012 by ASME.},

Due to the increasing functionality of automation systems and, thus, their increasing complexity, reuse of automation control software is currently achieved through copy, paste and modify. Therefore, module libraries containing verified control software are being developed to overcome these challenges. However, due to the differences of module structures in the disciplines participating in automation engineering, a pure syntactic software description based on inputs and outputs is not sufficient. Moreover, automatic retrieval of automation control software is needed to support the engineer implementing the entire system. In this paper, an approach enabling automatic retrieval of software units based on a module's hardware description by means of ontologies and customized rule-based inference is proposed.},

	abstract = {Performance of Geodatic Monitoring Systems Geodetic monitoring systems in these present days exhibit an extremely high level of automation. Commercial total solutions can be efficiently customised toward the individual demands of the object monitoring. A technical structure or a ground level surface can be analysed through the precise definition of the monitoring parameters, the observation of designated measuring points within the object measured and the description of the dynamic evaluation model. A variety of geodetic and geotechnical measuring sensors are available for the determination of geometrical changes within the object monitored. This article addresses the efficiency and performance of the monitoring systems with geodetic measuring instruments. High-end instruments are utilised in most applications of geodetic monitoring. In the process, the exact data analysis, as for example with deformations, crackings or oscillations, must be conducted individually. Another challenge is the automated processing of the enormous amount of observation data. The visualisation of the monitoring status and a suitable alarm through the network serves for a continual quality control. In addition, the reliability of the entire system must be ensured. For further distribution and reinforced application within the construction industry, mechanical engineering or within the various geosciences, these complex systems must increasingly be adapted to user needs. In addition, a reinforced integration of low cost-measuring systems is necessary. Copyright © 2012 Ernst & Sohn Verlag für Architektur und technische Wissenschaften GmbH & Co. KG, Berlin.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the methodologies and concepts used in the transition from Engineering Prototype Design to the consequent and necessary "scale up" of a product. Thus, it is related to the development of an aluminum injection mould for large scale production of a medical device (an orthosis for the correction and rehabilitation of the upper arm articulation). This medical device had its genesis in the analysis of several needs, linked to postural correction, detected in several Portuguese Hospitals which are specialized in physical rehabilitation, specifically in the rehabilitation of the upper arm articulation in stroke patients. The study, design and development of an adequate solution were carried out at the Department of Mechanical Engineering (University of Minho) in partnership with a Portuguese company of Project and Industrial Automation - DIVMAC (Biomedical R&D Department). Beyond the initial development of this product and having already in mind the evolution of this static device to a fully dynamic one, this work also presents the business model designed specially for the robotic product that will be developed soon. That business model provides many guidelines that could be useful for a wide group of products in the medical area. The construction was designed according the characteristics of the device, in this case an orthosis associated to a complex mechanical joint system. It is an innovative device, comprising three components of ergonomic support to the upper limbs, which are based on a mechanical linkage enabling the adjustment of the device to different individuals, and its use on wheelchairs. Apart from the above, it has four degrees of freedom, which allows a wide range of possible adjustments regarding several patients with different needs. This paper presents the development of the injection mould that consists of three cavities, each one corresponding to an ergonomic support component (elbows, forearms and hands), where foam of integral skin polyurethane (PU) of 300 kg/m 3 of density will be injected - the main material of the orthosis. However, it was designed a pre-mould in epoxy resin reinforced with particles of graphite, in order to validate the integration of the orthosis of PU with the mechanical system, and to obtain the first test prototype to measure the key technical requirements to be implement in the final mold of aluminum. Once the requirements in the outcomes of the rehabilitation process are increasingly high, it will be designed an evolution for the actual static device to a robotic system with dynamic feedback that mimics the different stages of rehabilitation performed by the physiotherapist with wireless EMG acquisition and electrotherapy. In this case, this is a much more complex device, from the standpoint of design, but also in terms of market acceptance and commercialization. The business model that best describes the main steps to be made for the approval/certification, marketing and distribution of the equipment produced will be proposed. The model was based on structural ideology and key principles of the business model Canvas, with particular emphasis on the cost structure, key partners, key activities, key resources, value proposition, customer relations and segments, distribution channels and, finally, all the possible paths to create revenues/profits in one spin off that was created to.},

The theoretical foundation for the growth design as well as the hierarchical tolerance evolutionary model is given. With the evolution of structure design in top-down style, the tolerance design develops and evolves in the same way, that is, following the evolution of product structure, tolerance grows from the initial accuracy requirements to the final state, during which the basic units in structure growth-functional surfaces and their nominal features are used as the tolerance evolutionary carriers. The basic method for the construction of two-layer correlation network including assembly network based on functional surfaces and constraint network based on nominal features is proposed, and the tolerance assertions to assist tolerance evolutionary design are given. The basic process for evolutionary design of dimensions chain and geometric tolerance based on the two-layer correlation network are presented. The tolerance design of a piston clamp is used as an example to demonstrate the successful application of the proposed tolerance evolutionary strategy in the incremental product growth design process. © 2012 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

The undergraduate degree program needs to provide this first opportunity at innovation allowing the student to gain experience and confidence at solving technological problems. This paper describes the learning experiences in innovation using an undergraduate course in robotics and automation. The course is composed of Mechanical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering Technology students. The paper relates the successful attempt the students had in developing and using innovation through the creation opened-ended industrial robot system projects. The undergraduate student project teams in the course are self-directed and have to use innovation to develop a robotic project of their own design. This breaks the cycle of students just doing the same preset experiments that others have done before them. Although doing preset experiments can reinforce theory given in classroom, it does little to develop skills in innovation, which will be the key to success in the global economy. The course provides an excellent framework for the student teams to demonstrate their ability to innovate using new technology to solve a complex problem while having the mentorship from instructors as they take their first steps in actually doing innovation. The confidence and process used to solve these problems will provide a basis upon which they can formulate new strategies to incorporate new technologies throughout their career.

	abstract = {With the development of analytical instrumentation to minimization, integration and automation, the microfluidic chips, which are more integrated, complex and diversified, have been applied widely on the manufacturing of analytical instrumentation. However, the present photolithography-based microfabrication technology, which is only able to pattern microchannels with simple inside structures, can not follow the rapid development of requirements. For solving the problem, a fabrication method based on the restricting effect of laminar flow is proposed for the micro etching on isotropic substrates. Experiments were conducted inside glass-based microchannels, in which certain etchant was used to form complicated microstructures. The flow parameters' effects on the aspect ratio, side wall profile and etching rate were revealed by the experiments. The experimental results reveal that the topography of micro structures patterned with the restricted flow etching method is mainly determined by the flowrates of separator and etchant. The computational fluid dynamics(CFD) model on the interface between multiple streams was established for the etching process, and analysis on the causes of various micro topographies was conducted based on the CFD simulation results. The experimental data consisted with the simulation results very well. The investigation depicted in this paper indicate that the flow restricted etching method provides sufficient references for the research and understanding on the mass transport at the liquid-liquid surface in the microchannel and can be used to pattern complex micro structures with high aspect ratios, meantime, it greatly enriches the microfabrication technology for microfluidic chips. © 2010 Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

This paper proposes a smart automated order tracking method that uses a combination of standard order tracking methods with some decision making. This approach can include computed order tracking based on angle domain sampling, the TVDFT approach, and/or the Vold-Kalman filter approach. The method can run fully automated or with limited to full user input as to how many decisions are made to obtain the best order tracking results possible. It is believed that this approach can significantly streamline rotating machinery analysis for noise and/or vibration. Finally, a philosophical discussion on making decisions to optimize order tracking results is presented. © (2012) by the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven Department of Mechanical Engineering All rights reserved.},

To alleviate this situation and assist students in visualizing control systems in practical situations, a half-credit elective control laboratory, which consists of five experiments and two laboratory projects, has been developed. These experiments will help students to understand the application of this topic and to learn to develop appropriate mathematical models and control routines in closed-loop systems with computers in the loop. © Manchester University Press.},

The system has been actively developed by two master degree students within a period of about 10 months, and will be used within laboratory activity modules in courses of Applied Mechanics and Manufacturing Automation. The first part of the paper presents the conceptual design of the manipulator, first by stating requirements and specifications, then by describing the design choices that have been done, from the point of views of system architecture, of mechanical systems, and of electronics and control systems. The second part of the paper presents the aspects of dynamic modeling that are involved in optimal joints movement interpolation, and the related algorithms that have been developed. The third part of the paper outlines the choices that have been done about the software environment (languages and development systems) and detailedly describes the software architecture that has been implemented at low level (i.e. programming of microcontroller that provides the motor driver function) and at high level (i.e. programming of the inverse kinematics, motor dynamics, 3-D motion simulator, user interface). The resulting system can operate in two modes: A manual/teaching mode, where the operator can move the manipulator by means of a joystick and pick a list of points to be saved on a file and routinely reached later on, and an automatic mode, where the manipulator autonomously moves through the points defined in a file (either manually written or created during a previous step while in teaching mode). The last part discusses how the described system suits within an advanced mechatronics course, and how an experimental module can be organized by exploiting the open architecture of the manipulator. © 2013 ASME.},

The disturbance input signal affecting the differentially flat linear system dynamics and time derivatives up to third order of the flat output, which are required for the controller implementation, are estimated by using a flat output-based high-gain dynamic observer.

Its mechanism of controlling welding deformation is based on reducing the longitudinal residual tensile stresses in and around the weld by means of extending shortened metal after welding with a columned extrusion head, which is pressed and rotated against the surface of workpiece behind the welding arc. WTRE equipment is simple and easy to implement automation and friendly to environment with low working noise. Experimental results show that this technology can reduce residual stresses and distortion of thin-plate weldments significantly. With appropriate technological parameters, WTRE can decrease the maximum longitudinal deflection of 2A12T4 aluminum alloy weldments, whose thickness are 2 mm, to below 4% of conventional value. ©2010 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

	abstract = {Tuned mass dampers are simple and efficient devices for suppression of machine tool chatter, which is one of the principal effects limiting productivity in many machining processes. However, their effectiveness depends on a proper tuning of the damper dynamics to the dynamics of the machine. This involves the dynamic characterisation of the machining process, in order to identify the critical resonance frequency, and the possibility of matching the resonance frequency of the damper to frequency. The difficulty of meeting these two requirements has been limiting the use of tuned mass dampers in industrial applications. An improved damper tuning device is presented here trying to overcome these limitations, and its feasibility is demonstrated with simulation and experimental results. On the one hand, the damper incorporates accelerometers and a control strategy that can detect in real time whether chatter is occurring and at which frequency in real time during the machining process. On the other hand, the damper has a variable stiffness spring, actuated by a motor, which allows automatic control of the stiffness, and thus the resonance frequency of the machine. Damping is generated in the damper by eddy currents, altogether providing a quite linear and predictable behaviour. © (2012) by the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven Department of Mechanical Engineering All rights reserved.},

By reusing existing solutions, the amount of work and costs within the product development process can be reduced. However, not only exact matches for a required solution are helpful, but also the suggestion of similar solutions could often meet the requirements and bring benefit. Therefore, the presented research aims at improving the process of retrieving existing solutions similar to a user query. This is achieved by developing an abstraction level in form of a shape classification for the objects handled in a technical solution. An ontology is used for modeling the required concepts and providing the necessary relations to shape classification. Semantic similarity measures are applied for calculating the similarity of technical solutions and the user query according to the information modeled in the ontology. With the help of a developed prototype that uses the ontology as knowledge repository for annotating and searching solution documents, the presented approach is applied and evaluated in the field of automation industry.

At the core of an automatic DoA assessment system are mathematical methods used to extract features from the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal which are mapped into an index. These mathematical methods may use frequency/time domain analysis to evaluate the change in the EEG signal such as frequency shift and amplitude change. Other methods use a probabilistic approach to measure the change of complexity in the EEG signal, such as, Permutation Entropy (PE) and Shannon Entropy (ShEn).

This paper elaborates a configuration study of a manufacturing system as well as illustrating basic design methodology of capturing user requirements and specifications for flexible reconfiguration in manufacturing automation system. The configuration study was conducted to accumulate various design outcomes from a given manufacturing process. The manufacturing process chosen for the study describes a simple yet easy to understand process in which groups of system design engineers were required to produce potential design configurations suitable for the process. The outcomes are then utilized to formulate a general rules for the configuration and reconfiguration methodology. The methodology presented is based on the steps and work descriptions provided by the user requirements and specifications. In order to simplify the configuration and reconfiguration works, method of capturing user requirements and specifications is required.

	abstract = {An integrated motion control model of path tracking and servo control is proposed for an automated guided vehicle (AGV) that suffers non-holonomic constraints and dynamic effects. Path tracking technique based on multi-step predictive optimal control and intelligent predictive iterative control is used to correct pose errors of AGV, which produces the limited speed difference output with the best coordination for error correction under velocity and acceleration constraints. Target velocities of two driving wheels are set according to this output and AGV moving speed. A multi-objective genetic algorithm takes servo control performances required by path tracking as its decision-making preferences, and it is used to optimize PID parameters of a servo controller that is responsible for eliminating velocity errors of driving wheels and making their actual velocities satisfy the requirements of path tracking. Velocity and acceleration constraints are adjusted as a feedback according to system response performances. AGV path tracking experiment demonstrates that this control model can match the capability of path tracking technique to correct pose errors with that of servo control technique to eliminate velocity errors, which can achieve the overall optimization of AGV motion performance. ©2011 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

In order to provide a comprehensive and systemic approach, a fluid-based slotting strategy is proposed in this paper. The configuration of CAOPS is presented with specific reference to its fast-picking and restocking subsystems. Based on extended fluid model, a nonlinear mathematical programming model is developed to determine the optimal volume allotted to each stock keeping unit (SKU) in a certain mode by minimize the restocking cost of that mode. Conclusion from the allocation model is specified for the storage modules of high-volume dispensers and low-volume dispensers. Optimal allocation of storage resources in the fast-picking area of CAOPS is then discussed with the aim of identifying the optimal space of each picking mode. The SKU assignment problem referring to the total restocking cost of CAOPS is analyzed and a greedy heuristic with low time complexity is developed according to the characteristics of CAOPS. Real life application from the tobacco industry is presented in order to exemplify the proposed slotting strategy and assess the effectiveness of the developed methodology. Entry-item-quantity (EIQ) based experiential solutions and proposed-model-based near-optimal solutions are compared. The comparison results show that the proposed strategy generates a savings of over 18% referring to the total restocking cost over one-year period. The strategy proposed in this paper, which can handle the multiple dispenser types, provides a practical quantitative slotting method for CAOPS and can help picking-system-designers make slotting decisions efficiently and effectively. ©2011 Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

The student team was composed of seven students within an aeronautical concentration of their Mechanical Engineering Technology program. The students designed and built a UAV capable of flying under direct manual control and indirect automatic control. Direct manual control was accomplished via a model radio-control transmitter, while indirect control accomplished via the onboard autopilot system. Programmable autonomous flight software, utilizing global positioning satellites (GPS), controls the autopilot system. A ground control station (GCS) sends and receives telemetry from a 2.4GHz modem located in the UAV. The GCS utilized Paparazzi, an open-source hardware and software autopilot platform, which allows mission specific flight plans to be created, uploaded, and executed and monitored during the UAV's flight. Real-time video from the UAV is transmitted to the GCS via an antenna and receiver. This comprehensive design and build project, concluding with successful test flights, enhanced the student learning and performance during the course of the project.

	abstract = {Based on feature compression with orthogonal locality preserving projection(OLPP), a novel fault diagnosis model is proposed in this paper to achieve automation and high-precision of fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. With this model, the original vibration signals of training and test samples are first decomposed through the empirical mode decomposition(EMD), and Shannon entropy is constructed to achieve high-dimensional eigenvectors. In order to replace the traditional feature extraction way which does the selection manually, OLPP is introduced to automatically compress the high-dimensional eigenvectors of training and test samples into the low-dimensional eigenvectors which have better discrimination. After that, the low-dimensional eigenvectors of training samples are input into Morlet wavelet support vector machine(MWSVM) and a trained MWSVM is obtained. Finally, the low-dimensional eigenvectors of test samples are input into the trained MWSVM to carry out fault diagnosis. To evaluate our proposed model, the experiment of fault diagnosis of deep groove ball bearings is made, and the experiment results indicate that the recognition accuracy rate of the proposed diagnosis model for outer race crack, inner race crack and ball crack is more than 90%. Compared to the existing approaches, the proposed diagnosis model combines the strengths of EMD in fault feature extraction, OLPP in feature compression and MWSVM in pattern recognition, and realizes the automation and high-precision of fault diagnosis. © 2011 Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

	abstract = {Robot welding is an important developing direction of welding automation and intelligentization, and automatic seam tracking technology is one of principal research domains. Nowadays, seam tracking system with structured light vision becomes a hot research. Structured light vision seam tracking products abroad are generally very expensive and can only be applied on special occasions. In China, the research of structured light vision seam tracking system is still just on the stage of experiments. A robot real-time seam tracking system with line structured light vision is designed. The hardware system is set up, a filtering method for line structure seam image is improved, and compared with common filtering, it has better effect and characteristic of real time. Two methods, fast template matching and fast Hough transform, to recognize the image coordinates of seam center are improved. Two new image recognition methods, structure element matching and corner detecting, are proposed. The comparison of seam image recognition shows that fast template matching and corner detecting are more precise and stable than the other two methods, and corner detecting is the best in real time. A simultaneous calibration for camera parameters and robot hand-eye is also proposed, and calculation shows that the calibration is effective and feasible. The robot seam tracking tests for linear and folded lap-joint are performed, which are based on the above four image recognition methods, and the results indicate that four image recognition methods are all applicable to real-time seam tracking, and the whole system sufficed for the requirements of real-time seam tracking. Automatic seam tracking with line structured light vision is feasible and has good versatility. © Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

	abstract = {The warehouses of the future will come in a variety of forms, but with a few common ingredients. Firstly, human operational handling of items in warehouses is increasingly being replaced by automated item handling. Extended warehouse automation counteracts the scarcity of human operators and supports the quality of picking processes. Secondly, the development of models to simulate and analyse warehouse designs and their components facilitates the challenging task of developing warehouses that take into account each customer's individual requirements and logistic processes. Automation in Warehouse Development addresses both types of automation from the innovative perspective of applied science. In particular, it describes the outcomes of the Falcon project, a joint endeavour by a consortium of industrial and academic partners. The results include a model-based approach to automate warehouse control design, analysis models for warehouse design, concepts for robotic item handling and computer vision, and autonomous transport in warehouses.Automation in Warehouse Development is targeted at both academic researchers and industrial practitioners. It provides state-of-the art research on warehouse automation and model-based warehouse design.

	abstract = {Airways of the peripheral lung are prone to closure at low lung volumes. Deficiency or dysfunction of pulmonary surfactant during various lung diseases compounds this event by destabilizing the liquid lining of small airways and giving rise to occluding liquid plugs in airways. Propagation of liquid plugs in airways during inflation of the lung exerts large mechanical forces on airway cells. We describe a microfluidic model of small airways of the lung that mimics airway architecture, recreates physiologic levels of pulmonary pressures, and allows studying cellular response to repeated liquid plug propagation events. Substantial cellular injury happens due to the propagation of liquid plugs devoid of surfactant. We show that addition of a physiologic concentration of a clinical surfactant, Survanta, to propagating liquid plugs protects the epithelium and significantly reduces cell death. Although the protective role of surfactants has been demonstrated in models of a propagating air finger in liquid-filled airways, this is the first time to study the protective role of surfactants in liquid plugs where fluid mechanical stresses are expected to be higher than in air fingers. Our parallel computational simulations revealed a significant decrease in mechanical forces in the presence of surfactant, confirming the experimental observations. The results support the practice of providing exogenous surfactant to patients in certain clinical settings as a protective mechanism against pathologic flows. More importantly, this platform provides a useful model to investigate various surface tension-mediated lung diseases at the cellular level. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

	abstract = {For the constant distance spacing policy, the existing researches of the string stability focus on the single-predecessor information framework(SPIF) and predecessor-successor information framework(PSIF). The research results demonstrated that the string stability could not be guaranteed with the SPIF, and then the PSIF was proposed to resolve this string instability. But the issue, whether the string stability can be guaranteed when applying the PSIF, is still controversial. Meanwhile, most of the previous researches on the string stability were conducted without consideration of the parasitic time delays and lags. In this paper, the practical longitudinal vehicle dynamics model is built with consideration of the parasitic time delays and lags existing in the actuators, sensors or the communication systems. Secondly, the detailed theoretical analysis of string stability in frequency domain is conducted to demonstrate that the classical linear control laws can not ensure the string stability when applying both the symmetrical PSIF(SPSIF) and asymmetrical PSIF(APSIF). Thirdly, a control law, which adds the position and velocity information of the leading vehicle, is proposed to guarantee string stability for small/medium platoon, and the other control law, which adds the acceleration information of the controlled vehicle, is proposed to guarantee string stability for large platoon as well as small/medium platoon. Finally, the comparative simulation is conducted to confirm the conducted analysis and the proposed control laws. The conducted research completes the means to analyze the string stability in frequency domain, provides the parameters' reference for the design and implementation of the practical automatic following controllers, and improves the reliability and stability of the platoon of automatic vehicles. © 2010 Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

	abstract = {The exact measurement of the fill level is the key and basic problem for automatic control and optimized operation of the coal pulverizing system. Because the ball mill pulverizing system is non-linearity, long time delay and time-varying, the reliable and effective method for measuring the fill level was lacked at present. In order to reduce the influence by various factors on measuring the fill level and improve the measuring accuracy of the fill level, a novel characteristic variable is proposed. A set of wireless transmission device was designed to record vibration signals, and an accelerometer with high accuracy and large measuring range was mounted directly on the mill shell to pick up the vibration signals from the mill shell. A series of data acquisition experiments under various ball load and water content of coal conditions were conducted in an industrial mill to investigate the relationship between the fill level and the angular position of the maximum vibration point of the mill shell through the analysis of the vibration signals. The analytical result of test data clearly show that the angular position of the maximum vibration point on the mill shell decreases as the fill level increases. At the same time, comparing with the traditional characteristic variable, the feature variable of the fill level proposed in this paper is not subject to the effect of the ball load and water content of coal, which provides a new solution and reliable basis for the accurate measurement of the fill level. ©2011 Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

	abstract = {Although there are many industrial machines used in marble industry, classification of marble slabs in terms of quality is generally performed by human experts. Due to economic losses of this rather subjective process, automatic and computerized methods are needed in order to obtain reproducible and objective results in classification. With the aim of remedying this insufficiency in marble industry, a new electro-mechanical system, which automatically classifies marble slabs while they are on a conveyor belt and groups them with the help of a control mechanism, is proposed. The developed system is composed of two parts: the software part acquires digital images of marble slabs, extracts several features using these images, and finally performs the classification using clustering methods. The hardware part is composed of a conveyor belt, a serial port communication system, pneumatic pistons, a programmable logic controller (PLC), and its control circuits, all employed together for grouping the marble slabs mechanically. Although similar studies exist, this paper proposes three novelties over the existing systems. Firstly, a new hierarchical clustering approach is introduced for quality classification without requiring a training set. Secondly, a new feature set based on morphological properties of marble surface images is proposed. Finally, an electro-mechanical system is designed for accomplishing the task of sorting out the classified marble slabs. In the literature, only a system with a labeling mechanism has been presented. Our system, on the other hand, comes with a complete conveyor belt acting as an element that links the production line with the proposed system. This allows the possibility of embedding the proposed system into the production line of a marble factory. It has been observed that although the performance of the developed system is not as high as neural network based systems that use training, it could still be employed in industry when there is no available training set of samples. With this advantage, it provides an increase in the quality control standards of marble slab classification, since marbles are classified with an objective and uniform-through-time criterion. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The demands from Airport Baggage Handling Systems continue to expand, seemingly demanding more (faster and more security checks) with less (less people and less energy). Increased airport security drives the need for more baggage inspection points. This in turn drives the need for more automation with the benefit of fewer people screened for secured areas. In addition, airlines and airports are placing more attention to reducing carbon footprint by investigating areas for improving efficiency, but within the overall scope of reliability and flexibility. One area in this investigation is the Queue Conveyor that "meter" (space bags evenly) or "queue" (hold and release) baggage to the next station. These belt conveyors differ from normal belt conveyors due to high start/stop cycling required that can reach 1 cycle per second. Belt conveyors in Airport Baggage Handling Systems typically in the past involved helical bevel right angle or multi-stage helical mechanical speed reducers. And for high cycling start/stop applications, these are fitted with a clutch/brake assembly between the motor and mechanical speed reducer. Newer approaches involving hypoidal gearmotors operated with an AC Speed Drives (often referred to as Variable Frequency Drives or VFDs for short) are being investigated. The hypoidal gearmotor is a more compact package than the existing designs-integrating a mechanical speed reducer with a motor. This new, compact form factor driven with a VFD seems to provide more throughputs with less mechanical elements and less energy usage. This paper will review the advantages and disadvantages of the hypoidal gearmotor method in the Queue Conveyor, supported with simulated test methodology and results. Particular focus of the test will include durability, energy savings potential, and applicability of AGMA service factor in gearmotor selection. Durability will focus on the mechanical components in the high cycle application as well as the thermal capacity of the motor. ©2010 by ASME.},

The control system of the balance bed is a complex, unstable, nonlinear system. To achieve balance of the bed, well-designed control system is particularly important. Presently, there are many different types of control methods, but the system of medical balance bed needs to control balance automatically and law regulating the parameters of the system in real-time, and to adapt to the impact of environmental changes, parameters change of the system itself and external interference, etc, so that the whole system can run in the best condition. Based on comparison and analysis of several typical control algorithms, this paper puts forward a neural network adaptive PID control algorithm. It can not only suppress the external disturbance, and adapt to the impact of environmental changes and parameter changes of the system itself, to some extent, but also can effectively eliminate the modeling error and other factors. This paper discusses the neural network adaptive PID control algorithm, and simulates using MATLAB to prove that the neural network adaptive PID control algorithm is better than PID control algorithm. © 2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Hydro-viscous winch is designed as a novel hoisting equipment based on original inclined mine hoisting winch and it overcomes the original winch shortcomings of low degree of automation. In order to research the starting performance of the winch, a simulation model was established in AMESim and the simulation results under the two start-up conditions, load on horizontal and load on slope, were analyzed. The results showed that the demand value of the input voltage is small if the hydro-viscous winch startup in the first condition; the practical output torque of the hydro-viscous brake initially changed following its response curve, but it had a sudden decrease at some time; it required a greater input voltage value if the winch startup in the second condition and the higher input voltage value may cause intense vibration for the system. The results of the simulation suggest that the start-up conditions greatly impact the winch starting performance. Therefore, the start-up conditions must be considerd during making the control strategy. © 2011 IEEE.},

In the conventional practice, the mechanical properties are tested after the product is manufactured. This leaves no room to take any corrective action. An accurate estimation of property during actual processing stage itself is required to control the cooling system. Danieli has developed PQM and QTB PLUS systems for monitoring and control of plates and bars respectively in real time. The estimation of mechanical properties such as Yield Strength, Tensile Strength, Hardness, and Elongation is made with the help of a series of interconnected, physically based mathematical models, complemented by empirical and data driven techniques to include processing uncertainties. The accuracy of the PQM system is ± 54 MPa for both YS and UTS, and ± 32 points for HV. And that for the QTB PLUS system is ± 20 MPa for YS, and ± 25 MPa for UTS. Such systems are useful for Testing, Quality Assurance, and Process Control. QTB Plus has been implemented in Riva Plants at Verona (Italy) and Seville (Spain). PQM is scheduled to be implemented in Iran this year.},

This study will aid the design and control of this kind of manipulators. This particular manipulator is well suited for industrial applications in aided automation manufacturing as well as medical applications for orthopaedic surgery robotics and micro holder for tactile sensing fingers. Based on the characteristics chart method proposed for closed-loop chains in former work (W.Z. Guo, H.J. Zou, B. Han, & Q. Zhang, Mobility of 4R1P-type five-bars using characteristics chart, Proc. ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference, Salt Lake City, Utah, 2004, 627-634; W.Z. Guo, Q.G. Huang, H.J. Zou et al., Grashof criteria for 4R1P-type five-bar planar parallel mechanisms with active/passive prismatic joint, Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering, 41 (8), 2005, 66-73. [in Chinese]), a complete classification and workspace composition are obtained for all the possible 3R planar manipulators. Class I manipulators have one inner circular dexterous regions, while Class II and III manipulators have no inner dexterous regions. If the three-link lengths are not equal to each other at all, the three classes of manipulators have an annular dexterous workspace when the shortest link is serving as the end-effector link. Furthermore, if any two links are the same in length, Class II and III manipulators have no dexterous workspace. By introducing the physical model of the solution space, workspace atlases are produced to show the global performance distributions over the link dimension range in terms of workspace classification, workspace shape, and workspace size. To investigate the joint rotation ranges of the manipulators including orientation capability of the end-effectors, joint space maps are displayed over the characteristics chart by using angled arc at end-effector position which denotes the joint rotation angle range. The study presents a useful tool to assist synthesis, analysis and motion planning of planar manipulators by describing global performances over the whole design space and the whole reachable workspace.},

	abstract = {Currently, virtual assembly technology has attracted increasing attention due to considerations of solving assembly problems in virtual environment before actual assembly in manufactory. Previous studies on kinematic analysis of mechanism only aim at analyzing motion law of single mechanism, but can not simulate the multi-mechanisms motion process at the same time, let alone simulating the automatic assembly process of products in a whole assembly workshop. In order to simulate the assembly process of products in an assembly workshop and provide effective data for analyzing mechanical performance after finishing assembly simulation in virtual environment, this study investigates the kinematics analysis of mechanisms based on virtual assembly. Firstly, in view of the same function of the kinematic pairs and the assembly constraints on restricting the motion of components (subassembly or part), the method of identifying kinematic pairs automatically based on assembly constraints is presented. The information of kinematic pairs can be obtained through calculating the constraint degree of the assembly constraints. Secondly, the incidence matrix eliminating element method is proposed in order to search the information and establish the models of mechanisms automatically after finishing assembly simulation in virtual environment. Both methods have important significance for reducing the workload of pretreatment and promoting the level of automation of kinematics analysis. Finally, the method of kinematics analysis of mechanisms is presented. Based on Descartes coordinates, three types of kinematics equations are formed. The parameters, like displacement, velocity, and acceleration, can be obtained by solving these equations. All these data are important to analyze mechanical performance. All the methods are implemented and validated in the prototype system virtual assembly process planning(VAPP). The mechanism models are established and simulated in the VAPP system, and the result curves are shown accurately. The proposed kinematics analysis of mechanisms based on virtual assembly provides an effective method for simulating product assembly process automatically and analyzing mechanical performance after finishing assembly simulation. © 2010 Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

	abstract = {Recent systems and techniques for damage detection based on vibration analysis are increasing their attractiveness in a wide range of applicative fields. Modal-based damage detection algorithms are wellknown techniques for structural health assessment, but the lack of automated modal identification and tracking procedures has been for long a barrier for the utilization of modal-based damage detection techniques as a component of monitoring applications. In fact, the automated identification of modal parameters is not a trivial task due to the extensive interaction from an expert user generally required by traditional modal analysis procedures. The development of different automated output-only modal identification procedures in the last few years renewed the interest in such techniques. However, robustness of the automated modal identification algorithms towards slightly non-stationary excitation, computational efforts and reliability of modal parameter and, in particular, damping estimates still represent open issues. The present paper deals with a hybrid algorithm for automated output-only modal parameter estimation for structural health monitoring purposes that is based on the lessons learned about the performance of popular operational modal analysis techniques. The novel algorithm has been obtained from different modal identification algorithms through a hybridization process and, so doing, some issues concerning the interpretation of stabilization diagrams are overcome. The control of the computational time and the capacity of providing reliable and very accurate damping estimates are among the primary advantages of the procedure. Its performance assessment is herein reported referring to the results of a number of benchmark case studies, made of both simulated data and real measurements. Capacity of the procedure to identify both fundamental and higher modes is also checked. Finally, a comparative assessment with the performance of another previously developed algorithm (LEONIDA) is illustrated and discussed in detail. Available results seem to confirm the robustness and accuracy of the algorithm, which has a large potential in the field of vibration based monitoring of civil structures. © (2012) by the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven Department of Mechanical Engineering All rights reserved.},

A series of processes such as the work hardening, dynamic recovery, nucleation and growth of recrystallization grains can be simulated. By employing the model, the dynamic recrystallization processes of pure copper under different temperature and strains rates have been simulated.

	abstract = {Since the early days of the Industrial Revolution, people have been managing the operational health of a wide variety of mechanical engineering systems, including industrial equipment and machinery, manufacturing plants, and transportation vehicles. Health management duties typically include monitoring the operational status of the system, diagnosing the source of an abnormal operating mode when one arises (typically, some form of component malfunction), and executing the procedures necessary to isolate and minimize the harmful effects of the malfunction and restore critical functionality. As the scope and complexity of mechanical systems has grown, so has the health management load on human operators. Fortunately, system health management (SHM) technologies have now advanced to the point where they can automate many health management (HM) activities. However, integrating SHM automation into what has traditionally been a human-centered activity raises a host of cutting-edge human factors issues. These issues include how to display systems information in a way that maximally supports human situation awareness and decision-making capabilities, how to determine appropriate levels of human-automation function allocation, and how to develop human-machine interfaces that most effectively support human-machine collaboration. In this chapter, we discuss these issues within the context of crewed spacecraft operations. Human-rated spacecraft contain very complex and often highly interconnected engineering systems, including propulsion systems; electrical and mechanical power generation and distribution systems; guidance, navigation, and control (GN&C) systems; data processing systems; life support systems; and communications systems. Particularly during the dynamic mission phases of launch, ascent, and entry, these systems must perform to precise operational specifications in very harsh environments, whose cumulative effects on system functioning are often poorly understood. Consequently, systems malfunctions are an ever-present threat to mission success and crew safety, and HM is a major element of mission operations. Current-generation spacecraft such as the Space Shuttles were designed and built several decades ago. Although quite advanced for their time, the Shuttle cockpits feature very little in the way of SHM automation and what designers of today's aerospace vehicles would describe as legacy crew-vehicle interfaces. The Shuttles thus provide an ideal platform to identify the human factor difficulties that accompany HM of very complex systems without the benefit of recent advances in SHM technology, and then illustrate the issues that arise when attempting to improve legacy operations with modern interfaces and improved SHM technology. We will therefore begin with a crew-centered overview of Shuttle HM operations, with a particular focus on the challenges crew members face when detecting, diagnosing, isolating, and recovering from time-critical systems malfunctions. This description provides a platform from which to launch a detailed discussion of a more advanced operational concept, targeted to next-generation vehicles, that blends modern cockpit interface concepts with SHM capabilities. Although the specific details of our concept are crew-centric, the underlying design issues (and examples of possible solutions) are generic enough to apply to a wide variety of operational environments, including mission control centers on the ground. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The inverse dynamics of this similar model is obtained by using the principal of virtual work; and to decrease the negative effect of the nonlinearity of the mechanism dynamics, the dynamic feedforward control method is adopted, distributing driving forces, which are needed for the tongs carrier of the manipulator to generate desired motions, to each hydraulic cylinder. The tracking performance of the tongs carrier is chosen to be guaranteed by improving the position response performance of each hydraulic cylinder. So, by using feedback linearization method and considering the nonlinearities of hydraulic systems, a hydraulic cylinder system is transformed into a second-order linear system which can be easily adjusted by setting four parameters to get desired damp ratio and natural frequency and to improve the response dynamics. Simulation results finally attest the validity of the proposed method. ©2010 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial laser scanners, as efficient tools, have opened a wide range of application fields within a rather short period of time. Beyond interactive measurement in 3D point clouds, techniques for the automatic detection of objects and the determination of geometric parameters form a high priority research issue. The quality of 3D point clouds generated by laser scanners and the automation potential make terrestrial laser scanning also an interesting tool for forest inventory and management. The paper will first review current laser scanner systems from a technological point of view and discuss different scanner technologies and system parameters regarding their suitability for forestry applications. Based on a large number of mixed forest plots, accuracy and handling of the laser scanner were tested. Furthermore a method for the automatic detection of the approximate position of trees will be presented. Co-ordinates of the approximate positions and the number of trees in the plots are a result of the first algorithm. In a second step all located trees will be separated and the breast height diameters, the profiles along the stem and their height will be determined automatically. Finally the paper presents results from several pilot studies on the application of terrestrial laser scanning in forest inventory tasks with the goal of automatically determining inventory-relevant tree parameters. The basic data sets have been provided using one terrestrial laser scanners, which based on phase measurement technology. © 2011 IEEE.},

In designing a framework that allows for a unified trust model or trusting picture and defining a reliable metric for measuring trustworthiness, we are examining definitions and methodologies from social sciences and engineering. This paper uses a combination of publication analysis of research literature including psychological, sociological, economic, automation, and cyberspace perspectives of trust and technical dialogues with the subject matter experts at the Air Force Research Laboratory, to illuminate the interdisciplinary approach undertaken in hardware centric design with human interface. We review past work to highlight trustworthiness characteristics and trust measurements that conceptually could apply across fields under examination.

Although some educational institutions do offer mechatronics as part of the curriculum, most often it is a course for electrical engineering majors. Since the use of automation involves other devices than electrical components, we developed a course for the Mechanical Engineering Technology (MET) students. These students have previous courses in machine design, production design, fluids (Pneumatics/hydraulics), and basic electrical circuits.

	abstract = {Spatial angle measurement, especially the measurement of horizontal and vertical angle, is a basic method used for industrial large-scale coordinate measurement. As main equipments in use, both theodolites and laser trackers can provide very high accuracy for spatial angle measurement. However, their industrial applications are limited by low level of automation and poor parallelism. For the purpose of improving measurement efficiency, a lot of studies have been conducted and several alternative methods have been proposed. Unfortunately, all these means are either low precision or too expensive. In this paper, a novel method of spatial angle measurement based on two rotating planar laser beams is proposed and demonstrated. Photoelectric receivers placed on measured points are used to receive the rotating planner laser signals transmitted by laser transmitters. The scanning time intervals of laser planes were measured, and then measured point's horizontal/vertical angles can be calculated. Laser plane's angle parameters are utilized to establish the abstract geometric model of transmitter. Calculating formulas of receiver's horizontal/vertical angles have been derived. Measurement equations' solvability conditions and judgment method of imaginary solutions are also presented after analyzing. Proposed method for spatial angle measurement is experimentally verified through a platform consisting of one laser transmitter and one optical receiver. The transmitters used in new method are only responsible for providing rotating light plane signals carrying angle information. Receivers automatically measure scanning time of laser planes and upload data to the workstation to calculate horizontal angle and vertical angle. Simultaneous measurement of multiple receivers can be realized since there is no human intervention in measurement process. Spatial angle measurement result indicates that the repeatable accuracy of new method is better than 10″. Proposed method can improve measurement's automation degree and speed while ensuring measurement accuracy. © 2010 Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

Current tools for performing NOTES are based on the flexible endoscopy platform, and are significantly limited in imaging and manipulation by the size and geometry of the natural lumen. For NOTES to revolutionize minimally invasive surgery, new approaches are necessary that enable the surgeon to perform procedures with vision and dexterity equivalent to laparoscopic procedures. An image-guided, two-armed, dexterous miniature NOTES robot has been developed that can be placed into the peritoneal cavity through a transgastric incision. Using this robot, the surgeon has effectively demonstrated tissue dissection in non-survivable animal model procedures. A next step in the development of miniature in vivo robots is the automation of routinely performed, low level surgical tasks. This paper details work towards autonomous tissue dissection using the NOTES robot. As a first step, visual tracking and robot control methods are being developed. Copyright © 2008 by ASME.},

	abstract = {For the large wrap-around surface, it is difficult to parameterize the data due to without obvious rectangular boundaries. Meanwhile, the modeling process is inefficient since it involves frequent manual operations. Therefore, a method of combined B-spline surface reconstruction is proposed. First, a method of recognizing the projection axis from sampled points is given, and these points in physical space are projected to two-dimensional space by using the mapping method. Consequently, the boundary curve is divided into four boundary curve segments according to the characteristic of the boundary curve, and then region segmentations and quick parameterizations of points are realized by utilizing Coons surface forms. B-spline surface patches are further reconstructed from segmented point sets. This modeling strategy is very helpful to improving the efficiency and automation of modeling process. In addition, in the process of constructing combined surfaces, a smooth blending method with G1 geometric continuity is provided between two adjacent patches. Examples verify the feasibility and validity of the proposed modeling and blending methods for combined surface reconstruction. © 2010 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

	abstract = {The mechanical press driven by the common AC motor and based on the crank-linkage-slider mechanism is still widely used in the field of mechanical manufacturing. Such press is characterized by poor dynamics performance, serious noise pollution, low energy efficiency, unbalanced overall structure and cumbersome appearance. The object of this paper is to introduce a CNC press driven by the high-speed linear servo motor and based on the two-stage symmetrical orthogonal toggle force amplifying mechanism. Its working principle is to amplify the thrust or tension generated by the high-speed linear servo motor through the two-stage orthogonal toggle force amplifier and then to transmit to the output slider, called pressure head, which finishes the press work on the work piece. The electromechanical integration press has the following advantages: (1) Comparatively low noise pollution for the removal of rapid rotating motor and components. (2) Improved dynamics performance by the computer numeral control of the speed of the pressure head. (3)The magnitude of the stroke and output force of the pressure head can be adjusted in a wide range by editing the program to control initial pressure angle and end pressure angle of the toggle mechanism. (4) Because the force acted on the pressure head in the horizontal direction is symmetric and balanced, theoretically, there is no friction on the pressure head. It is not only good for energy saving, but also for the prolonging of the service life of the machine.(5) Higher level of automation and intelligence than the hydraulic press, and it is free from hydraulic oil pollution.

	abstract = {Friction joining processes are largely investigated due to its potential to avoid metallurgical and economical problems related to fusion welding processes. Among these processes, friction stir spot welding (FSSW) has become a very active field of research. The process is a variation of the friction stir welding where a tool comprised of a shoulder and a pin penetrates into an overlap joint plasticizing the material and consolidating the joint leaving a keyhole after tool removal. FSSW is an alternative process to resistance spot welding, as well as for the mechanical fastening (riveting and clinching). There are many advantages using this process in relation to conventional resistance spot welding and mechanical fastening methods including avoidance of solidification and metallurgical defects (solid state welding process), environmentally friendly, ease of process automation and no additional metal. Twelve different tools profiles and three rotational speeds were tested to perform the welds. The plunge rate, plunge depth and dwell time were kept constant. Four samples were produced to perform the mechanical testing (shear test) and two samples were produced to metallographic characterization (optical and scanning electron microscope). Microhardness profiles were made in the metallographic samples. The result of mechanical testing indicates that higher values of rotational speed give an improvement on the mechanical strength of the welds. The different tools had also shown different results for mechanical testing and metallographies. For the metallographic samples, three different zones could be observed: The Stir Zone (SZ), the Thermo-Mechanically Affected Zone (TMAZ) and the Base Material (BM). The observation of the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) was only possible by microhardness profile testing, were the four zones were observed. Copyright © 2009 ASM International® All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Software to support the solution generation phase of the engineering design process has been developed in academia for decades. Computational synthesis software enables generation of solutions on both conceptual and embodiment level. This paper focuses on the class of parametric design, such as documented in mechanical engineering handbooks. Examples include machine elements such as bearings, springs, fasteners, transmissions, etc. A parametric synthesis tool automates the engineering design process from functional requirements to quantified solutions, for a single machine element. Since the amount of machine elements is vast and software development time should be low, a generic methodology is helpful to speed up this process. This paper discusses such a methodology to develop synthesis tools for the class of parametric designs. It includes an analysis-oriented approach to formalize the design process' parameters in terms of embodiment, performance and scenario. Mathematical constraint solving techniques are used to generate candidate solutions. Graphical presentation and exploration of the solution space is done with interactive plots. A standardized layout for the graphical user interface is suggested to allow uniform and intuitive use. A demonstrator is developed using the described methodology and several challenges are discussed for improved constraint solving techniques, more advanced visualization and handling problems with higher complexity. Although small in size, parametric design processes are time consuming due to their reoccurring nature. Developing synthesis tools for these designs will allow engineers to save time and improve design quality. Copyright © 2007 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Weighing and blending process is an important step of industrial and agricultural production. Traditionally, the simplest way of weighing and blending is to weigh the variety of raw materials manually and mix them together. There are some disadvantages of this method, such as measuring inaccurate, low productivity and labor-intensive. The comparatively advanced method is making use of the computer control technology to realize automatic weighing and blending according to predetermined formula. According to the production characteristics and technological requirements of a certain chemical product, an integrated control system of weighing and blending for liquid raw material based on DCS (Distributed Control System) is developed in this paper. The system is composed of IPC (Industrial Personal Computer), ADAM data acquisition modules, weighing sensor and execution unit. The 485 bus is adopted to transmit data between the different equipments. With the support of SQL Server 2000, the process control and production management of weighing and blending are realized with C++ builder 6.0. The integrated system can be divided into three subsystems, namely, the process control subsystem, the production monitoring subsystem and the production information management subsystem. The application result indicates that this system improves the production efficiency and stabilizes the production process. Copyright © 2010 by ASME.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an automatic blasting vehicle for ship bottoms. A blasting bead with two degrees of freedom, including roll and pitch angles, is mounted on a moving vehicle through a vertically stringing mechanism. The blasting head is lifted by the swinging mechanism through hydraulic power. With the use of a pressure relief valve in the circuit design, the blasting head is always automatically pushed against a curvilinear surface of a ship bottom during the blasting process. Steel abrasive particles are fed into a hydraulic pump and are projected centrifugally at high speed toward the surface to be blasted Rubber seals between the blast machine and the hull ensure that all the abrasive, dust, and paint chips during the blasting process are directed back to the machine through a hopper. High-speed air is blown in to carry dust and paint chips into a dust collector while the heavy abrasive particles continue to fall and are recycled into the hydraulic motor. When compared to the open blasting process operated by workers, this automation process drastically reduces the cost of man-hours, abrasive consumption, and total blasting cost. It also improves the working condition of the workers since there is no dusty environment, which is a problem in the current industry practice of open blasting. Engineering Technology faculty members at Old Dominion University were funded by local shipyards to develop the device. The faculty incorporated several senior Mechanical Engineering Technology students to contribute to the design for their capstone design project.},

	abstract = {Early in the design process, it is desirable to produce a large number of potential solutions. However, completely exploring a problem's solution space is an unreasonable expectation for an unaided designer or design team. Computational tools have emerged to help designers more fully explore possible solutions during conceptual design. These automated concept generators use knowledge from existing designs and the desired functionality of the new product to suggest solutions. Existing automated concept generation methods produce many candidate solutions, but often provide the designer with unmanageably large sets of solutions. Techniques are needed to organize the set of concepts into smaller groups, more easily parsed by the human designer. This work proceeds from the hypothesis that the utility of automated concept generators can be enhanced if their output is first sorted into clusters of similar concepts. A general method is developed to estimate a variety of attributes, related to customer needs, and design for "X" parameters, for each concept based on data stored in a design repository. A technique for aggregating parameter estimates into a vector of concept attributes is discussed and a method for clustering concepts based on attribute vectors is presented. Finally, a case study showing the clustering method applied to a simple design problem with design for manufacture and assembly constraints is detailed. The proposed methodology allows designers to make a first pass rejection of concepts with undesirable attributes and suggests a group of concepts that merit further study.

System components and hand prototypes reflect many years of experience of our laboratory in rehabilitation medicine, CAD design and prototyping, mechanical engineering, electronic construction, and programming. Prototypes of hydraulically actuated hands were tested by patients under support of orthopaedic companies. The latest hydraulic prostheses have advantages in construction, design, and performance, including adaptivity during grasping and holding of objects. The newly developed miniaturised hydraulic system is competitive with standard mechanical systems of electrically driven prosthetic hands. The modular construction of the system developed allows for customising the mechanical construction of each prosthetic hand and its functional abilities. Contributions of patients concerning grasping activities of prostheses may be taken into account when choosing the hand components already. The components of the new hydraulic actuation system and their technical characteristics will be interesting for specialists in automation technology, actuator development, mechanics, prosthetics, and rehabilitation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The integrated approach is validated using a simple yet characteristic example part that demonstrates the potential of the approach and the interplay and interfaces between the methods.

In particular, we demonstrate how to convert a caterpillar-like soft-bodied robot from a lumped-parameter form into a CAD model that could be easily manufactured. To simplify this design problem, we propose a decomposition method involving three steps. The first step groups the elements of the lumped model into segments. This segmentation simplifies the second step, where rough CAD models are automatically synthesized for each segment from the union of many prisms. In the third step, a human designer combines and smoothes these segment models to create a fullbody CAD model. This, approach simplifies the development of a high degree-of-freedom soft robot by guiding the designer to a final model with an almost fully automated process. Copyright ©2009 by ASME.},

	abstract = {During transportation by ambulance, a patient is exposed to inertial acceleration when an ambulance decelerates or turns a corner. Such acceleration often gives a patient physical stress such as blood pressure variation or body sway, which causes strong pain, feeling of discomfort or sometimes critical damage for seriously injured persons. To reduce this undesirable effect of the acceleration, the authors developed the actively-controlled bed (ACB) which controls the posture of a stretcher in real time to reduce foot-to-head and lateral acceleration acting on a supine person. This paper describes development of the ACB, including control system design and performance evaluation. The control system is designed by Zakian's framework, which comprises the principle of matching and the method of inequalities, so that the design specifications on the tracking error and the motor torque are satisfied. From the results of driving experiments and simulation, it is estimated that the ACB can reduce the acceleration acting on a patient by 65% in the foot-to-head direction and by 75% in the lateral direction. © 2009 Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer-Verlag GmbH.},

Two state variables of the underactuated system are chosen to construct the first-layer sliding surface. Then, the first-layer sliding surface and one of the left state variables are used to construct the second-layer sliding surface. This process continues till the last sliding surface is constructed. For an underactuated system, which consists of 2n state variables, the sliding surface has (2n-1)-layer structure. For guaranteeing every sliding surface can converge rapidly to zero, we design a new sliding mode control law. Using Lyapunov law, we prove the stability of all the sliding surfaces theoretically. On account of saturation nonlinearity of the control input, asymptotic stability of the control system is proven by nonlinear small gain theorem. The simulation results show the validity of this method for this class of underactuated mechanical systems. © 2008 IEEE.},

In this paper the problems of improving the accuracy of modal parameter estimates and automatic elimination of spurious modes in covariance driven subspace identification method are addressed. An iterative procedure is proposed, which in the first step, actively modifies the excitation signal, resulting in improvements of identification results. In the second step, for spurious mode elimination, an alternative stabilization histogram is introduced to automatically combine and extract identified modal parameters. It is shown that use of measured output signals, of different sampling rates, along with the combination of identified results on a single stabilization histogram, can enhance the effectiveness of spurious modes rejection. An active composite beam is selected to demonstrate the application of the proposed procedure. The method is then coupled with a finite element model updating algorithm to identify different damage cases. The developed procedure allows automatic and accurate generation of modal parameter residuals facilitating the fault detection algorithm to precisely locate the damages. © 2008 by the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven Department of Mechanical Engineering All rights reserved.},

Mechanical Engineering Technology, B.S. Computer Engineering Technology and B. S. Technology/Manufacturing curriculum. Industry today desperately needs skilled engineers and manufacturing professionals that can modernize and improve manufacturing processes and product designs for manufacturability to be able to compete in the "global economy" of today. Therefore automation skills need to be introduced to the student in all three of the above degree programs. The author's describes how his industrial experience helped him shape an interdisciplinary course that challenges the student to be creative and build on the strengths of his/her fellow students in four degree fields. The student of today needs to be more "Job Ready" and not just "know the theory" if he/she is to compete for the jobs of tomorrow. This includes being able to work in interdisciplinary groups to accomplish project goals. The use of self directed laboratory experiences can keep the students engaged and active in learning the course objectives. The use of laboratory teams made up of the different degree programs more closely simulates the reality of autonomous interdisciplinary design teams in industry today. The paper will relate how the course has become one that the students not only come willingly to formal lab hours, but insist on having expanded access to make their project come to life. Employers today are also looking for employees that can accomplish smaller automation projects without having to hire a consultant that leaves as soon as the start button is pushed. The paper will relate examples of industrial alliances and how students have stated that the experience in the classroom has translated to the student being more "Job Ready" and actually receiving job offers due to these laboratory experiences. Finally the paper will give the authors lessons learned and reflections for the future of the course to respond to a changing industrial landscape. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2007.},

This task is, in principle, similar to other equilibration problems where the control-system has to balance the controlled body about a position of unstable equilibrium. Our robot, called ERROSphere (Equilibrating Robot Rolling On Sphere), uses a mechanically simple drive-assembly and a special control architecture to achieve the closed-loop stabilization. This paper introduces the structure of the robot, and summarizes the first stage of our experiment. Our present goal has been only to stabilize the robot locally about the static unstable-equilibrium position. However, a successful device of this nature opens prospects for a versatile new type of drive-mechanism for locomotion applications. The control strategy employs two non-coupled linear models, which mimic the movements of the robot in two orthogonal projection planes. The balancing controller uses optimal control theory employing a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) model based on a linear approximation of the system equations. © 2005 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a genetic algorithm-based approach for automatic functional design of mechanical systems. The proposed method automatically finds a set of optimal or near-optimal design solutions with respect to desired functional requirements stored in a pre-built device database. Although, typically, the design solution space of a given mechanical system is very large, the proposed strategy can generate high-quality design solutions in a timely manner. The method considers life cycle cost (LCC) factors as one of the design optimization criteria, since LCC factors have an important impact on product competency in the current market. Fuzzy logic is used to transform linguistic design requirements into numerical values. A case study is presented to illustrate the operation of the genetic algorithm-based functional design method and the efficiency of the method for optimizing the final design.},

	abstract = {This paper provides the design of a simple robotic arm for pick and place operations as well as other material handling operations. The movements of the arm are anthropometric i.e. resembling the human arm with respect to degrees of freedom so as to provide a human touch in industrial and space operations. This system operates using controlled motion of DC geared motors along with a microcontroller based system (8051 or PIC based). Use of PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) can be used to control the RPM of DC geared motors. This system has the advantage of being simple and low cost with a varied flexibility of operation. A collective array of sensors viz. voice sensor, infrared light sensors, proximity sensors etc. can be incorporated to form a feedback induced closed loop system. Whereas for tasks of picking and placing at a fixed location from another location the system can be operational at open-loop. The material for the robotic arm can be polypropylene or acrylic or aluminium to reduce weight without compromising on the strength and lifting capacity of the robotic arm, such that the torque of the DC geared motors (actuators) at each joint are sufficient to lift the arm along with the weight at the end effector. Clutch and gear shifting mechanism can be used to increase the degrees of freedom per actuator. The driving circuit mainly consists of the microcontroller and H-bridge drivers using an 8-bit port to control 4 DC geared motors per port simultaneously or one at a time using delay commands. DC geared motors are quite cheaper than stepper motors and RC Servos thus reducing the total cost of the system drastically. Plus being light weight, DC geared motors reduce the total weight of the system. This paper will also throw light on the programming aspects for the microcontroller (8051 or PIC based) along with the compatible flash programmers and HEX code generators. This project will further explain on the approach followed in the mechanical design of the robotic arm (motion, work volume etc.) as well as the possible future applications of the robotic arm. Also the design of the robotic arm on CAD tools like Solidworks will be discussed in brief along with the modeling and simulation of the various links of the arm as well as the whole assembly of the system. With increasing popularity of Automation, robotic arms are the present and future of all industrial operations. Finally the paper concludes on the further improvements in design and technology.

This paper surveys and evaluates different approaches to defining complexity in design for the design problem, process, and product. Three fundamental aspects to complexity are identified, size, coupling, and solvability, and expanded with respect to the three elements of design, problem, process, and product. Alternative methods for measuring these characteristics of the design are based on computational, information, and traditional design views of complexity. A method of measuring size as it relates to complexity is proposed for measuring the information content of design. A second method is proposed for decomposing a graph-based representation of design that provides a measure of the interconnectedness as it relates to complexity. Finally, two methods are proposed for determining the solvability complexity of design based on the effort involved and the degree of freedom of design. These measures are developed specifically for parametric and geometric problems as found in the embodiment design, but these principles may be applied beyond this. Copyright © 2010 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Numerous investigators, observing that conventional transit systems are no match for the automobile on a modern road, have sought a means for movement of people that would attract many more riders while reducing costs. Understanding the benefits of automation, this activity led to the consideration of systems consisting of very small, automatically controlled vehicles running on a network of small, low-cost elevated guideways. To obtain adequate capacity and to decrease trip time, the stations would be placed off-line. In this way the system would have the attractiveness of a freeway, which permits private travel at minimum trip time, but would require a great deal less space. In the late 1960s this concept became called Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) and governments began investing in it. Unfortunately, there are a great many ways to design a PRT system and at that early stage there was no serious theoretical work to determine how best to accomplish such a design. As a Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Minnesota, the author became interested in this problem in 1968 and during the 1970s was able to study all of the PRT work underway around the world, and thereby develop a comprehensive set of criteria to guide him to an optimized version of PRT. That version is now called SkyWeb Express. The paper briefly discusses the advantages of use of off-line stations and the design of the necessary guideway, vehicle, station, operations, and control system. Means for obtaining the necessary safety and reliability are then discussed, followed by a brief discussion of system costs and cost effectiveness. Finally, a list is given of benefits for the community and the patrons. © 2005 WIT Press.},

	abstract = {The capability of docking, refueling, repairing, and updating microsatellites using automatic autonomous vehicles will be of significance critical value for design and operation of several space systems in the near feature. Automatic docking capability was successfully tested by many institutions such as National Space Development Agency in Japan, European Space Agency, National Aeronautics and Space Administration in USA, etc. However, there is still much more space for improvement of degree of automation during the process of docking with large deviations of the initial attitude. A novel automatic autonomous probe-cone docking mechanism used for microsatellite docking is proposed. This docking mechanism is designed according to the design indices such as miniaturization, degree of automation and automatic capture capability within large deviation of the initial attitude. On the basis of the virtual work principle, the dynamics modeling of the docking process is presented. The position of the contact point is then analyzed. Comprehensive system level simulation is conducted in the 13 kinds of typical operating conditions with the initial deviations. Capture performance is analyzed. The simulation results show that the docking mechanism can be smoothly captured within 2 s in all cases of large attitude deviation between the active and passive spacecrafts. A virtual prototype model of the docking mechanism is established through ADAMS for further verifying the correctness of the buffer parameter model and the autonomous docking capability. A laboratory platform is designed for on-the-ground experimental validation of the property of mini probe-cone docking mechanism. Repeated docking tests prove the proposed design of the mini probe-cone docking mechanism system for its high reliability, and automatic capture capability within large attitude range. The kinetic model of the docking capture process and the mechanism structure could provide some references for similar mechanism design of in-orbit spacecraft. ©2010 Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

A practical method for the dimensional synthesis of slidercrank mechanisms is proposed by referring to a classical approach, which is based on the use of the centrodes, inflection circle, cubic of stationary curvature, cubic curve of centers and Ball's point. Usually, in the industrial practice, the generation of a specific continuous path is not required because, very often, only the shape and the overall size of a coupler curve is sufficient to satisfy the design specifications. Thus, this paper gives a contribution to the dimensional synthesis of slider-crank mechanisms by formulating a practical and intuitive procedure, in order to obtain two different shapes of path, a symmetric egg shape path with a straight segment part and/or stationary curvature and a raindrop shape path, which both respect the required overall sizes. © 2008 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a topic that has been researched heavily over the past 50 years, especially since the accessibility to sufficient computational resources has greatly increased. However, it is precisely this increase in technology that has led to a lack of efficiency in many CFD developments, especially when it comes to the process of grid generation. While many researchers are currently focused on solutions to the grid generation problems of traditional CFD techniques, the majority of these approaches still suffer serious numerical difficulties due to the underlying CFD solution algorithms that are used. Therefore, the focus of this work is to demonstrate a novel approach to true CFD automation which is based on traditional Cartesian grid generation coupled with a Meshless flow solution algorithm. As Meshless method solutions require only an underlying nodal distribution, this approach works well even for complex flow geometries. And with the addition of a so-called shadow layer of body-fitted nodes, the stair-casing issues of typical Cartesian solvers are eliminated. This paper will describe the approach taken to automatically generate the Meshless nodal distribution, along with the details of an automatic local refinement process. Also, as the primary interest of automated CFD is for aerospace applications, this work includes the development of standard two-equation turbulence models for use in this Meshless based solver. Finally, results will be shown for the application of high-speed, compressible turbulent flows. Copyright © 2009 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Fluidized beds utilize a gas stream to fluidize solid particles and are used in the process industries because they provide a low pressure drop, uniform temperature distribution, and high heat transfer rates. Knowledge of fluidized bed hydrodynamics is necessary in the design and scale up of such devices. However, fluidized bed hydrodynamics are difficult to visualize and quantify because the systems are opaque and intrusive probes do not provide satisfactory measurements. This paper describes the development of X-ray particle tracking velocimetry (XPTV) to study fluidized bed hydrodynamics. XPTV utilizes X-rays to track specially designed tracer particles in a fluidized bed to noninvasively determine particle velocities. Stereoscopic X-ray imaging is used to locate the 3D position of the tracer particle as a function of time within a fluidized bed, from which particle velocity can be determined. An example of particle tracking will be shown and the automation of this process will be described. Copyright © 2008 by ASME.},

The main focus of the mechatronic approach is to extend and to complete the design process of mechanical and more general engineering systems by incorporating from the very beginning sensors and controllers - which includes also the required information processing - and thus being able to generate partly intelligent products. The components and modules of such systems originate from mechanical engineering, from electrical engineering or from other engineering domains. Methods for describing and designing these components and modules are based in the fields of applied mechanics, electrical engineering, system theory, control and automation theory, and information processing. In particular, in mechatronic systems like robots, manipulation systems, machine tools, or all kinds of vehicles, the multibody systems approach offers a powerful tool to model the mechanical properties of the system in an appropriate manner. In this paper, methodologies for the development of formalisms and software for modeling and simulation of multibody and mechatronic systems will be presented and illustrated by examples from automotive systems and robotics. © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

	abstract = {The integration of electronic units, sensors and actuators into complex function-oriented systems is one of the key points in the development of intelligent fibre composites. A wide range of materials is available for that purpose, for example piezoelectric textile sensors, fibre-optic fibres as well as shape memory alloys and prefabricated information elements. These elements can be used to create active fibre composites ("smart composites") with selective properties, which are suitable especially for application in stressed lightweight components. While the functionality of these solutions could be proved on a laboratory scale, appropriate manufacturing strategies for a competitive series production of components in automotive and mechanical technologies have not been realised so far. One crucial obstacle which impedes a breakthrough for such active lightweight components is the lack of technologies suitable for large-scale production. Generally, these complex systems are manually integrated into the fibre composite with either prefabricated layer materials or as individual elements, or applied to the surface of the fibre composite compound, thus preventing process automation. Therefore, the goal of the Institute of Mechanical Engineering and Plastics Technology (Chemnitz University of Technology) is to develop application-oriented technological solutions for series production.

The plant under consideration is a pneumatic cylinder supplied with pressurized air by an electropneumatic servovalve. This system is often applied as the final control element of the controller in automatic control systems.The correction device for the mentioned plant will be a digital computer. The pure inertial load of the pneumatic cylinder will be time variable. Therefore this plant belongs to the unstationary class of systems. For time varying desired output value the control algorithm will be synthesized. The control algorithm is based on the self-adjustment principle. Structural characteristic of such a control system is existence of two feedbacks: global negative of the output value and local positive of the control value. Such a structure ensures synthesis of the control without the internal dynamics knowledge and without the measurement of disturbance values. The mentioned control forces the observed plant output to track the desired output value with the prespecified accuracy. In this paper simulation results produced by the practical tracking control algorithm on an electropneumatic piston drive will be presented. © 2010 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

In this paper, a multilayer feedforward network is applied to a robot visual servo control problem. The model uses new neural network architecture and a new algorithm for modifying neural connection strength. No a-prior knowledge is required of robot kinematics and camera calibration. The network is trained using an end-effector position. After training, performance is measured by having the network generate joint-angles for arbitrary end effector trajectories. A 2-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) parallel manipulator was used for the study. It was discovered that neural networks provide a simple and effective way of controlling robotic tasks. This paper explores the application of a neural network for approximating nonlinear transformation relating to the robot's tip-position, from the image coordinates to its joint coordinates. Real experimental examples are given to illustrate the significance of this method.

In this paper, a methodology is presented to describe the kinematic characteristics of mechanism systems and their associated requirements so that they can easily recognized by computers. A practical approach is to define "a kinematic function" to represent the kinematic characterizations of a mechanism. It reflects the input and output motion of a given system. This kinematic function can regularly and accurately be described using function units and trees (any function tree consists of more than one function units and is regularly expressed). Because of its uniqueness, the process of mechanism synthesis can be easily recognized by a computer. The methodology demonstrated in the paper has universality and has been successfully incorporated into a software, which has been proven to be an useful tool for the conceptual design of mechanism systems. © 2008 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

	abstract = {This paper presents how a senior capstone project can be utilized to build partnerships between the academia and several companies representing key industries in modern robotics technology. The project can be described as designing a portable robotic workcell for industry to showcase state-of-the-art equipment and technologies in robotics. The industrial sponsor for this project is Applied Manufacturing Technologies (AMT) located in Orion, Michigan. AMT plans to use the workcell for demonstrating current robotics technology in tradeshows, industrial open houses and/or robotics conferences. In addition, the workcell is to be used as a platform to provide training to engineers working in robotics industry on robot programming, machine vision and systems integration. The small size, flexible design and durability make the workcell appealing to many other applications in robotics engineering. An engineering senior project design team composed of one computer engineer, two electrical engineers and two manufacturing engineering technologists at Lake Superior State University has worked on this project as their capstone design requirement through the 2007-2008 academic year. Lake Superior State University offers ABET accredited programs in computer, electrical and mechanical engineering as well as in manufacturing engineering technology. Robotics and automation is a degree option in all majors. The capstone senior design project is an integral part of all the degree programs and provides a real-life experience for the engineering senior students. The two-semester course has been an important tool to introduce students to soft skills such as project management, communications, engineering economics, and engineering ethics. The paper illustrates how a capstone design project can be used to build partnerships in robotics technology. An educational partnership between Lake Superior State University and Applied Manufacturing Technologies has quickly expanded to include many other partners such as Bosch Rexroth and Siemens. The paper discusses the technology used in designing the portable robotic workcell as well as the capstone design course in detail. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2009.},

	abstract = {Carnegie Mellon University s departments or Architecture and Mechanical Engineering have teamed with Milwaukee School of Engineering's Mechanical Engineering department to design and install a biodiesel fueled engine-generator with heat recovery equipment to supply electric and thermal power to an office building on campus, the Intelligent Workplace (IW). The installation was completed in early September 2007, and is currently being commissioned. Full scale testing will begin in early 2008. The turbocharged diesel engine-generator set is operated in parallel with the local electric utility and the campus steam grid. The system is capable of generating 25 kW of electric power while providing 18 kW of thermal power in the form of steam from an exhaust gas boiler. The steam is delivered to a double-effect Li-Br absorption chiller, which supplies chilled water to the IW for space cooling in the summer or hot water for space heating in the winter. Furthermore, the steam can be delivered to the campus steam grid during the fall and spring when neither heating nor cooling is required in the IW. Additionally, thermal energy will be recovered from the coolant to provide hot water for space heating in the winter, and for regenerating a solid desiccant dehumidification ventilation system in summer. All relevant temperatures, pressures, and flows for these systems are monitored via a building automation system. Pressure versus time measurements can be recorded in each cylinder of the engine. Emissions of nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (NO2), Paniculate Matter (PM), and carbon dioxide (CO 2) are also monitored. Upon completion of this installation and the system performance testing, the operation of the engine generator with its heat recovery components will be integrated with the other HVAC components of the IW including a parabolic trough solar thermal driven LiBr absorption chiller, a solid desiccant dehumidification ventilation system, and multiple types of fan coils and radiant heating and cooling devices. This energy supply system is expected to reduce the IW's primary energy consumption by half in addition to the 75% energy savings already realized as compared to the average US office space.

	abstract = {The rejection of perturbations is a classical problem in control theory. Part of the interest in the rejection of persistent disturbances is focused on those perturbations affecting nonlinear systems [Chen, C.W., 2006. Stability conditions of fuzzy systems and its application to structural and mechanical systems. Advances in Engineering Software 37(9), 624-629; Isidori, A., Astolfi, A., 1992. Disturbance attenuation and H∞-control via measurement feedback in nonlinear systems. IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control 37(9), 1283-1293]. This paper, firstly, analyzes some literature contributions which tackle the problems of using fuzzy models as representations of the nonlinear behaviour of the real system-and shows the drawbacks of these methods. Secondly, a method for designing parallel distributed compensation fuzzy state-feedback controllers is proposed. This new approach is based on minimizing the 1-norm between the disturbance input signal and output signal. Specifically, an upper bound on this norm, the {star, open}-norm, is minimized, which, unlike the 1-norm, can be formulated in terms of linear and bilinear matrix inequalities. This novel contribution presents two main advantages with respect to previous works-firstly, it considers a priori bounds on the applied persistent perturbation. Secondly, it provides a minimized upper bound on the output. The proposed method has been tested on a mechanical system with nonlinear behaviour. By means of this example, we show that the minimization of the {star, open}-norm can also limit the control actions, if they are very large. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paper characterizes the bridge and the monitoring system used and presents the results achieved, for a period of 6 months, with a software developed in Matlab environment, to process the data that is received at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP) through an internet connection. The implemented routines perform on-line automatic identification of the bridge modal parameters using two different approaches: the Frequency Domain Decomposition method and the Covariance driven Stochastic Subspace Identification (SSI-COV).

The communication network may be physically wired or not. The widespread applications of the Internet have been a major driving force for research and development of NCS. NCS have advantages in terms of cost reduction, system diagnosis and flexibility, minimizing wiring and making the addition and replacement of individual elements relatively simple; efficient data sharing makes taking globally intelligent control decisions easier with an NCS.The applications of NCS are very wide, from the large scale of factory automation and plant monitoring to the smaller but complicated networks of computers in modern cars, places and autonomous robots.Networked Control Systems presents the most recent results in stability and robustness analysis as well as new developments related to networked fuzzy and optimal control. Many of the chapters contain details of case-studies, experimental, simulation and/or other application-related work showing how the theories put forward can be implemented in real systems.The state-of-the art research reported in this volume by an international team of contributors will make Networked Control Systems an essential reference for researchers and postgraduate students in control, electrical, computer and mechanical engineering and computer science. © 2008 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

	abstract = {The aim of the research is to outline a sustainable implementation model for flexible machine shop automation. The research is a 20-year longitudinal study of the development of Finnish machine shops applying flexible manufacturing systems. The development is assessed in terms of socio-technical and organisational change as well as operational performance. The object of the research is the product workshop of the case study company, with 13 Finnish machine shops serving as reference material. The success of the implementation of flexible manufacturing systems was assessed over a long time span. In its approach to flexible manufacturing systems, the research draws from the socio-technical systems theory, which combines the technical and the social system. The discussion aims at expanding the described system into an entity constituted by flexible production automation and production arrangements as well as the organisational approach. The research falls into the areas of industrial psychology and industrial economics. The first specific objective of the empirical part of the research was to find out how flexible manufacturing systems were implemented. This specific objective was analysed through a description of the case study project implementation, with which the project implementations in the reference material were compared. The second specific objective was to study the impact of the implementation of flexible manufacturing systems on the workshop's production, organisation of work, work content and productivity. This specific objective was analysed using multifaceted research methods. The third specific objective of the research was to discover the differences between successful and unsuccessful implementation projects. The purpose of this analysis was to identify the critical factors of implementation, through which the model for sustainable implementation was defined. The research showed that there were considerable differences between the implementations of flexible manufacturing systems, which also had a long-term impact on the development of productivity. According to the research, the work related to flexible manufacturing systems has become physically more demanding and the time pressures have grown during the last 15 years. When comparing successful and unsuccessful implementation projects, there were differences between the implementation speed and the development of productivity, and the systems of successful projects lasted longer. The prepared model for sustainable implementation can be applied to demanding system implementations in the mechanical engineering industry. The model also describes the long-term significance of productivity improvement in the production unit. The described socio-technical system underwent changes during the research. According to the research, the best result is attained by a production model that combines the characteristics of the socio-technical and lean production models. Copyright © VTT 2007.},

	abstract = {Intelligent cutting operations capable to adjust in-line their process parameters in order to accommodate unexpected changes of working conditions are more and more desirable in order to increase the current automation level. In order to do that, a general model of the cutting process under investigation needs to be set up in advance, and then, during cutting, continuously compared with the output of process sensor signals. Among the different phenomena that contribute to the general cutting model, the evaluation of the tool wear is a matter of primary importance. The in-line prediction of tool wear critical levels would indeed prevent the production of components of unacceptable quality. The paper presents the development of a tool condition monitoring system and its preliminary results applied to interrupted cutting operations. In the paper first part, the process sensors implemented in the system for in-line acquisitions are described and their distinctive but complementary function in the system evidenced. Later on, the FE-based numerical model of the reference process is presented together with the approach followed for its calibration. It is shown that the numerical model is well suited to reproduce process mechanics, giving chance to understand how wear advancement affects process parameters and component quality. This knowledge can be exploited in building up a general model for wear evolution. Finally, data acquired by process sensors are further elaborated into process control charts that can help in monitoring the tool state as its wear evolves during cutting. Copyright © 2010 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Automatic lowering system is usually a significant process in the course of complete automation of gyroscope. In view of the current gyroscopes, an automatic lowering project is proposed based on camshaft under the control of rotary stepped motor, and the fixing structure is designed as well as the whole control system. By analyzing influence factors during the course of lowering, the relationship between initial condition of gyroscope and half-away position while lowering is obtained through a lot of experiments when the swing is within the ideal range. Based on this, the adaptive intelligent motion control system is proposed, i.e. a lowering speed scheme database is built on the basis of the relationship between the initial condition and half-away position. For different initial conditions, corresponding half-way positions are automatically inquired, then the motor speed is set, thereby realizing intelligent control. Through tests of stability, swing range and repeatability of the automatic lowering system, it is shown that the gyroscope is always in normal working range with different conditions and its running is stable, which proves that the control system is effective and reliable. By the project, the bottleneck of swing control in automatic lowering is solved effectively, the automation level and the measurement accuracy are improved significantly. © 2010 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

	abstract = {Intensive global competition requires the automotive manufacturers to launch new vehicle models with a shorter launch time, better quality, lower cost and more customization. One of the key enablers for achieving these objectives is to have an efficient & error-free manufacturing automation system which is typically controlled by Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC). The current PLC logic code testing process in automotive industry is usually performed manually by individual engineer, and the overall testing quality highly depends on the engineer's expertise and experience. The PLC logic code testing normally consists of two parts, testing requirements (specification) and testing methods. One of the major hurdles for applying rigorous testing methods on PLC logic verification in industry is the lack of formal testing specifications. The current PLC testing specifications and requirements are documented in various formats, such as sequence of operation document, process instrument diagram, wiring diagrams, and time motion diagrams, etc. These varied documents cannot be directly used for control logic testing and require a better alternative. Formal methods, the latest technology widely used in software testing, is an approach selected for generating comprehensive test cases to ensure the correctness and consistency of PLC programs. This paper presents a novel approach for specifying the expected behavior of the already implemented industrial PLC code. The generated formal specification models can work with math-based logic verification tool to facilitate the usage of formal verification in manufacturing automation control. The specification modeling methodology contains all the required information from different logic design and testing phases, such as process sequence, wiring information, logic pattern, code comments, and domain knowledge, etc. And the statecharts is used as model formalism, because of its capability to model states hierarchically and provide a better visual representation.

	abstract = {Audio-based tools can enhance the learning experience in introductory modeling and control classes at the undergraduate (sophomore) level in the mechanical engineering curriculum. An example audio-based learning tool that we propose is the "FlexSynth," a sen'o-actuated flexural rocker arm that sways to an electronically generated music. We have built and tested the FlexSynth as part of a project under the MIT advanced graduate subject 2.737 Mechatronics class offered in Fall 2007. The angular range of the rocking motion of the flexural arm in the FlexSynth is mapped to a set of musical notes. While the flexural rocker swayed to the generated 'command' music, its motion is also converted into an equivalent 'response' music. Two speakers are used, one to play the commanded music and the other to play the response music. The performance of control algorithms (such as proportional or proportional-integral control) can be discerned from the command and response music, and compared for better musical quality. The appeal of an electromechanical system, driven by music and controlled to see the 'dancing' flexural rocker, makes the overall system an interesting show-and-tell for young kids or the public at large, getting them excited about science and engineering automation. Advanced control issues such as filtering of flexural damping modes of the rocker can also be addressed with this system implementation. Advanced students in the controls area can study the design tradeoffs between robustness and speed in following the command music. While the usual debugging tools such as multimeters, oscilloscopes, and dynamic signal analyzers allow for hands-on learning about the performance of a control system, an audio-based unit such as the FlexSynth can be a valuable addition to the innovative teaching tool kit.

Electron beam lithography is used to fabricate gold seeds, which is followed by copper deposition via electroplating. To improve the structure precision, we first present a model for seed-initiated material growth based on Green's function calculations. This model is then used to develop an algorithm for optimal seed planting to produce the highest accuracy object with the fewest number of tool moves. Both the model and the optimization algorithm are validated by experimental results. ©2010 IEEE.},

Today, global competition is forcing manufacturers not only to contain costs but also to improve quality of products and processes. Thus, the purpose of automation has shifted to broader issues. Highly automated processes ensure high quality on a constant level. But, increasing the degree of automation also increases the consequences of error. Therefore, a high degree of automation requires a high degree of (automated) monitoring and control. Consequently, a steady need for automated non-destructive testing (ndt) is observed in industry. Integrated process and condition monitoring by ndt is an accepted procedure to early diagnosis of irregular process conditions followed by feed back control and optimization. It was forecast in different studies of the market, that this process integrated ndt will record two-digit rates of increase within the next years. Process integrated ndt has to fulfil the requirements of today's industrial production concerning integrability, automation, speed, reliability and profitability. Meanwhile, examples can be found in metal production, automotive and mechanical engineering.},

Traditionally, such a design process is largely based on experience and best practices, often ineffective and non-optimal as the system becomes complex. This paper proposes a new, systematic method for automatic assembly sequence design and optimization. Key elements include assembly modeling, sequence planning, locating scheme optimization, dimensional quality evaluation, and optimization. First, a directed graph and an assembly matrix are employed to describe the assembly relation of a system. Then, the feasible assembly sequences are generated through layered subassembly detection of adjacency matrices, filtered by engineering constraints. To evaluate quickly the assembly quality and compare the influences of different locating point schemes, a linear 3D variation propagation analysis model with deterministic locating principle is introduced. The optimal locating scheme is then selected using a genetic algorithm with the least variation propagation. Finally, the assembly dimensional quality for different sequences is evaluated and the optimal assembly sequences are achieved through genetic algorithms. A case of automotive body side assembly is presented to illustrate the whole methodology. © 2009 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

	abstract = {In this paper the possible applications of vision techniques for modal analysis are presented. The following issues were investigated: a) automation geometry mapping and measurement points' localization in the preliminary phase of modal experiment; b) vibration measurement of selected elements of a construction; c) executing a modal test. For this purpose procedures and algorithms were developed on the basis of vision-technique methods. Applying and developing passive 3-D vision techniques resulted in achieving 3-D structure of the construction. The passive techniques, as opposed to the active ones, carry out depth measurements based on supplied image-sequences from one or more cameras. Stereovision algorithms were developed and used, based on a single camera-image acquisition. The amplitude of vibrations was calculated for selected construction points. Each point was represented by a spatial marker. The markers were characterized by symmetrical spatial structure. Methodology and algorithms based on model and symmetry properties (some regularities) of measurement points were developed to compute the vibrations amplitude. Algorithms developed were implemented and tested in MATLAB programming environment. Necessary vision data were received from high-speed digital camera "X-Stream Vision" in the form of "avi" files that constituted input data for developed algorithms. © (2006) by the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven Department of Mechanical Engineering All rights reserved.},

Since the quality of the entire process is increasibly dependent on the maintenance process, these processes must be carefully designed and effectively implemented. There are various techniques and approaches at our disposal, such as technical, logistical and intensive application of the information-communication technologies. This last approach is presented in this paper. This approach begins with organizational goals, quality objectives in particular. Then, maintenance processes and integrated information system structures are defined. Maintenance process quality and improvement processes are defined using a set of performance characteristic, with a special emphasis placed on the effectiveness and quality economics. The paper also presents the structure of the information system for improving maintenance economics as well as simulation software solution for integrating maintenance and production functions.

	abstract = {This paper provides the design of a simple robotic arm for pick and place operations as well as other material handling operations. The movements of the arm are anthropometric i.e. resembling the human arm with respect to degrees of freedom so as to provide a human touch in industrial and space operations. This system operates using controlled motion of DC geared motors along with a microcontroller based system (8051 or PIC based). Use of PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) can be used to control the RPM of DC geared motors. This system has the advantage of being simple and low cost with a varied flexibility of operation. A collective array of sensors viz. voice sensor, infrared light sensors, proximity sensors etc. can be incorporated to form a feedback induced closed loop system. Whereas for tasks of picking and placing at a fixed location from another location the system can be operational at open-loop. The material for the robotic arm can be polypropylene or acrylic or aluminium to reduce weight without compromising on the strength and lifting capacity of the robotic arm, such that the torque of the DC geared motors (actuators) at each joint are sufficient to lift the arm along with the weight at the end effector. Clutch and gear shifting mechanism can be used to increase the degrees of freedom per actuator. The driving circuit mainly consists of the microcontroller and H-bridge drivers using an 8-bit port to control 4 DC geared motors per port simultaneously or one at a time using delay commands. DC geared motors are quite cheaper than stepper motors and RC Servos thus reducing the total cost of the system drastically. Plus being light weight, DC geared motors reduce the total weight of the system. This paper will also throw light on the programming aspects for the microcontroller (8051 or PIC based) along with the compatible flash programmers and HEX code generators. This project will further explain on the approach followed in the mechanical design of the robotic arm (motion, work volume etc.) as well as the possible future applications of the robotic arm. Also the design of the robotic arm on CAD tools like Solidworks will be discussed in brief along with the modeling and simulation of the various links of the arm as well as the whole assembly of the system. With increasing popularity of Automation, robotic arms are the present and future of all industrial operations. Finally the paper concludes on the further improvements in design and technology.

	abstract = {The aeronautic industry has to face the demand of cost reduction by its customers. These costs are divided into acquisition and operating costs. Both can be reduced by optimization and automation of production steps and by using highly integrated light weight structures. Within the EU-founded FP 6 project ECOSHAPE a laser beam forming (LBF) process for the laser beam bending of complex fuselage aluminum panels has been developed. The aim was to build up the fundamental know-how for an industrial manufacturing process performing most production steps in flat condition due to a minimum of machining costs, technological complexity and a maximum of robustness and reliability. To facilitate the cost intensive qualification of the LBF-process the metallurgical behavior of the aluminum alloys is investigated as well as the influences of the single structural elements of the fuselage panels like stingers and pockets on the forming result. For the industrial upgrade the process is integrated into a discrete control loop using the geometry of the panel as control variable. © German Academic Society for Production Engineering (WGP) 2008.},

	abstract = {According to the fundamental importance of the tracking theory on technical systems, the main goal of this paper is a further development of the theory and the application of the tracking, especially to the practical tracking concept. The new definition of the practical exponential tracking is shown. The practical tracking is defined by the output vector, which is different from the former definitions, given by the output error vector. The defined exponential tracking is elementwise. The new criterion of the practical exponential tracking is shown. Based of the new criteria, the control algorithm of practical exponential tracking is determined by using the self-adaptive principle. The structural characteristic of such a control system is the existence of two feedback sources: the global negative of the output value and the local positive of the control value. Such a structure ensures the synthesis of the control without the internal dynamics knowledge and without measurements of disturbance values. The plant under consideration is an electro-pneumatic servo motor. This system is often applied as the final control element of a controller in automatic control systems. The correction device for the mentioned plant will be a digital computer. The mentioned control forces the observed plant output to track the desired output value with prespecified accuracy. In this paper the simulation results produced by practical tracking control algorithm on an electro-pneumatic servosystem will be presented. The results show a high quality of the practical exponential tracking automatic control. The type of the control ensures the change of the output error value according to a prespecified exponential law. © 2008 Journal of Mechanical Engineering. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The scattering of elastic waves by cracks in isotropic and anisotropic solids has important applications in various areas of mechanical engineering and geophysics, in particular in ultrasonic nondestructive testing and evaluation. The scattering by cracks can be investigated by integral equation methods, eg, boundary element methods, but here we are particularly concerned with more analytically oriented hypersingular integral equation methods. In these methods, which are only applicable to very simple crack shapes, the unknown crack opening displacement in the integral equation is expanded in a set of Chebyshev functions, or the like, and the integral equation is projected onto the same set of functions. This procedure automatically takes care of the hypersingularity in the integral equation. The methods can be applied to cracks in 2D and 3D, and to isotropic or anisotropic media. The crack can be situated in an unbounded space or in a layered structure, including the case with an interface crack. Also, problems with more than one crack can be treated. We show how the crack scattering procedures can be combined with models for transmitting and receiving ultrasonic probes to yield a complete model of ultrasonic nondestructive testing. We give a few numerical examples showing typical results that can be obtained, also comparing with some experimental results. This review article cites 78 references.},

	abstract = {This contribution reports on a type of pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) that was recently developed at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, department of Mechanical Engineering. Its distinguishing feature is its pleated design. Duo to this, it has a very high contraction force and an equally high travel. The weight of these pleated PAMs is very low: a muscle of only 60 gr can pull up to 3500 N and contract by an amount of 42%. Furthermore, dry friction and associated hysteresis, typical of many other designs, is avoided by the folding-unfolding action. This significantly simplifies position control using these actuators. Although the force-displacement characteristics of out actuators are non-linear, they can be effectively controlled using basic linear PI techniques. Another advantage of these actuators is their inherent and controllable compliance, making them ideally suited for walking/running machines or whenever delicate tasks, e.g. handling fragile objects, have to be performed. In view of all charac teristics pleated PAMs are very well suited for automation and robotic applications.},

	abstract = {Four point bending (FPB) is a cornerstone element of the beam flexure portion of a sophomore-level mechanics of materials course. The FPB lecture has traditionally developed the theory from free body diagram through beam deflection, with related homework problems providing analytical practice. Similarly, the FPB laboratory, which has been essentially unchanged for nearly two decades, has provided students an opportunity to experimentally and analytically verify and validate beam flexure theory. Although excellent correlation between theoretical and experimental results was frequently obtained, hardware requirements have limited the accuracy and amount of data that collected within a standard 110-minute laboratory session. Recent FPB laboratory upgrades utilizing data acquisition (DAQ) hardware and software have enabled the students to test a much larger sample of beams in roughly the same timeframe with increased repeatability. The DAQ upgrade has facilitated increased understanding of flexural theory, introduced modern experimental methods in both lecture and laboratory, given students a more robust data set upon which to base their analyses, and enhanced student experiences with technical report writing. This paper includes an overview of FPB theory, analysis techniques, and traditional laboratory procedures, and details the success of the FPB DAQ upgrade, operation, and outputs.},

The common axis is capable of rotating about a vertical axis intersecting it. The drive, termed dual-wheel transmission (DWT), is composed of two identical planet-gear trains, lying at two different levels and coupled by a common planet-carrier. The latter can turn freely with respect to the robot platform carrying the motors, the transmission having, as a stand-alone unit, three degrees of freedom and only two motors, which makes it underactuated. Upon coupling this drive with two other wheel units, which is the minimum required for static support, a robot with mobility of three is produced, the underactuation thereby disappearing. Finally, the dimensioning of the DWT is reported for robustness against manufacturing, control and sensing errors. © 2003 IEEE.},

The main object of the presented research was to determine the efficiency of multi-shuttle systems versus single-shuttle systems, which represents the main share and support in the design process of automated storage and retrieval systems. An improvement of the throughput capacity of the transport unit load is possible with the use of multi- versus single-shuttle systems. Single-shuttle systems are frequently used in engineering practice, and they are based on the dual command cycle, while multi-shuttle systems are based on the quadruple and sextuple command cycles. The main problem is how to incorporate an appropriate control policy so that the condition of minimal empty travel of the storage and retrieval machine will be fulfilled. A special heuristics method, "Strategy x", that sequences storage and retrieval requests in order to minimize the average travel time has been used for this purpose. Discrete event simulations were used to evaluate the heuristics performances within multi-shuttle systems. The results of simulation analyses showed significant improvements in the throughput capacity for multi-shuttle systems in comparison with single-shuttle systems. © 2004 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

	abstract = {Robotics is often viewed as a complex high-tech area that can be applied to improve productivity but only at a high cost to the organization. Contrary to this frame of mind, robotic applications can be implemented by average-sized organizations at a relatively low cost with low complexity. As part of the senior design project activities at Lake Superior State University, an automotive parts supplier submitted a project involving the redesign of a manual machine tending process. The company, which manufactures tie rods, has a process where an operator tediously loads and unloads tie rods to and from two machines in a dirty and dangerous environment. A flexible system to automate the machine loading process was considered and will be proposed. The flexible automated system will include a parts feeder for orienting the tie rods into a single position and a robot for picking and placing the tie rods into the machines. The end-of-arm tooling for the robot and the parts feeder will be designed to handle different varieties of tie rods. The automated system flexibility will allow the robot, which will be mounted on a track, to be conveniently re-positioned away from the machines when needed. By doing so, the machines can be run in the manual mode for unusual tie rod part varieties using an operator to tend the machines. In addition to presenting an uncomplicated robotics solution to the problem, this paper will show that by incorporating the proposed automation ideas, the hardware costs to implement the flexible robotics system will be under $100,000. This is a relatively low cost for an average-sized company, considering automation. Copyright ©2002 by ASME.},

	abstract = {There is a revolution underway in military aircraft assembly. This has been spurred by a combination of customer demands for faster and less expensive solutions, competition in the global aircraft market, and the opportunity to capitalize on technologies that have been developed for other industry segments. In addition, the workforce in military aviation in the US is aging and there is a need to train and educate a new workforce. This paper describes the formation of a unique consortium and the resultant strategic alliance(s) that are formed involving aircraft manufacturers, their equipment suppliers, and education. At the forefront of the educational efforts is Mechanical Engineering Technology. MET is in a unique position to assist in the test, evaluation, modification and technology assessments for their strategic industry and supplier partners. At the same time students are familiarized with the specific processes that the technology addresses and the problems of industry that the technology is targeted to resolve. The involvement of universities in industry research facilitates the familiarization of students with the unique and current problems faced by industry so that graduates enter the work force ready to assimilate into the value stream with minimum training and instruction. The development of a collaborative project between Northrop Grumman Corporation, M. Torres, SA, and the MET Department of Purdue University is discussed. The goal of this project is to develop a lower cost method of fixturing aircraft parts during assembly, with an integrated metrology system. Particular emphasis is placed on overcoming and aligning the scheduling, cultural and business obstacles in bringing together a Spanish machine builder, an American aircraft manufacturer and an academic department to address all aspects of the problem.

	abstract = {Hard turning is the process to watch in many industries, as it is a perfect candidate for the actual trends toward automation and flexible manufacturing. However, there are still many possible conjunctures created by different geometries or materials of the workpieces versus different types of cutting tools with effect on workpiece surface quality, tool wear, machine tool vibrations, etc. These insufficiently explored combinations make manufacturers hesitate to adopt hard turning as a finishing process. This paper brings new findings concerning the effect of cutting parameters and tool nose radius variations on surface finish as a result of continuous and interrupted hard turning. The considered workpieces are a camshaft made of AISI 1117 steel at 62 HRC for continuous cutting, and a spline shaft made of AISI 1137 steel at 48 HRC for interrupted cutting. Two types of PcBN cutting tools are used for both types of component parts. The investigation highlights the differences between the ideal, geometrically determined, surface roughness Ra and the experimental results, as well as the differences recorded between the continuous and interrupted cutting situations. The factorial experimentation technique was employed taking the resulting surface roughness (Ra) as a response variable. The influence of tool wear was finally considered in the analysis of the predicted values of roughness obtained through characteristic regression equations. A significant difference of roughness evolution versus tool wear was recorded for the continuous and interrupted surfaces. The analysis was completed based on profilometry and light interferometry measurements as well as optical and SEM microscopy observations.},

Based upon an assessment instrument used by Addington and Johnson at VMI (1999), this instrument measures the quantity and quality of learning opportunities and student achievements relative to the student learning outcomes. All results are selfreported by the students using a 5 point Likert scale. The instrument was first piloted Summer 2002 then extensively revised and given again during the Fall 2002.

	abstract = {Nearly every manufacturing operation relies on servo-controlled automation and inspection machines. The design of these machines requires close attention to the relationships of the mechanical system with the electronic control system. Often, the attributes of one component can augment the weaknesses of another, and vice versa. For example, linear motions are traditionally produced with a rotary motor and ball screw. Recently, linear motors have gained popularity because of their numerous advantages. However, the servo-controls can, more easily, excite resonant frequencies in the machine structure. Therefore, controlling the machine at various speeds can produce excessive structural vibrations as different modes are excited. Thus, improvement in one component causes difficulties with another. An efficient solution is a tuned mass damper (TMD). This is a simple, modular device that consists of a weight, mounted on a spring along with a viscous energy absorber. The tuned mass damper is placed where the undesired vibratory motion is greatest. The size of the mass, spring and damper are adjusted, or tuned, so they oscillate out-of-phase with the structure and reduce the amplitude of vibration. This paper will review the theory of tuned dynamic dampers, and illustrate an application of integrating them into the design of a coordinate measuring machine.},

A fundamentally new approach to automated, massive, parallel manipulation of small-sized parts is explored in this paper: the pneumatic active surface device (PASD). With the appropriate choice of force -caused by blowing or sucking air-flow through the tubes of the pneumatic active surface device - objects placed on the array can be moved in useful ways. Such a device offers great flexibility and speed and can be employed to position, orient, identify, sort, feed, and assemble parts or objects. Another advantage is that several objects can be controlled simultaneously.

	abstract = {Friction phenomenon can be described as two parts, which are the pre-sliding and sliding regions. In the motion of the sliding region, the friction force depends on the velocity of the system and consists of the Coulomb, stick-slip, Streibeck effect and viscous frictions. The friction force in the pre-sliding region, which occurs before the breakaway, depends on the position of the system. In the case of the motion of the friction in the sliding region, the LuGre model describes well the friction phenomenon and is used widely to identify the friction model, but the motion of the friction in the pre-sliding such as hysteresis phenomenon cannot be expressed well. In this paper, a modified friction model for the motion of the friction in the pre-sliding region is suggested which can consider the hysteresis phenomenon as the Preisach model. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed friction model, the sliding mode controller (SMC) with hysteresis friction compensator is synthesized for a ball-screw servo system.},

The accuracy and handiness of the velocity measuring method are often become a key about the practicability of the NDT method. In this paper, based on the transient elastic wave theory, an elastic-wave-velocity measurement system was developed. The interdisciplinary techniques related to civil engineering, electronic engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer science were integrated to make this system more stable and easier to operate on the construction site. The processes during the measurement such as data capturing, signal processing and even data analysis are accomplished by the controlling software automatically. The measurement will be completed in seconds. Therefore, lots of data could be gathered in very short time and then used to estimate the quality of concrete. Besides, the wireless data transfer technology was also adopted in this system. With this function, more experts could monitor the measurement simultaneously through the Internet. In the preliminary experiment, the result shows good correlation between the wave velocity and the compression strength. It demonstrates the potential of this system on the application of NDT technology.},

It presents a new mechatronic approach to machine control, which introduces an integrated and interdisciplinary method to holistic machine design. The mechanical, electronic and informatics aspects of a production system are involved synergistically. The paper describes a distributed control architecture for a cutting machine. In addition, it applies a new approach to the development of control functions. The controller was built on the open QNX real-time operating system for the PC architecture. The commonly accepted graphical-user-interface environment of Microsoft Windows serves as the front-end of the HMI. The controller and the HMI are interconnected by an Ethernet TCP/IP link that is extended to the office-level of factory automation. A new method for describing logic control functions introduces a modular logic controller that is specified and formalized using a matrix representation of Petri nets. It allows a system simulation and an off-line analysis that can significantly shorten a machine control development cycle. The new method is compatible with standard programming languages for logic controllers. Furthermore, it represents a basis for the design of more efficient, reliable, and user-friendly machine control. © 2004 Journal of Mechanical Engineering. All rights reserved.},

This paper documents the challenges and progress made in developing and teaching a robotics based introductory engineering course at Mount Holyoke College. The course was offered for the first time in Spring '04 and, after modifications, was offered again in Fall '04. Though the hands-on design experience of building an autonomous robot proved successful in the first version of the course, we found that the time and frustration involved in programming autonomous robots prevented students from being exposed to a wider array of engineering problems and skills. Through the development of wireless communication and tele-operation laboratory modules, we hope to shift the focus away from the programming complexities involved in an autonomous robot competition and towards the robotic system itself, allowing students to more fundamentally explore both component and system issues. At the component level, students in the second course are more substantively exposed to electronics and modeling while the coupling of the new laboratory modules with novel teaching pedagogies provides an opportunity to explicitly address systems issues such as component integration, communication, and sensor networks. As motivating female engineers is our guiding priority, it is the goal of this course to combine the strengths of a hands-on design course with a rigorous introduction to necessary tools, intuitions, and critical thinking that will help enable the student to grapple with many different engineering problems both in academia and the real world.},

This has lead to a paradigm shift from hardware- to software-oriented systems. The advancement of material and its manufacturing technology has lead to availability of light-weight vessels and higher performance goods, and oil crises have lead to a paradigm shift toward energy conserving vessels and goods. The advent of semi-conductor and integrated circuits has lead to a paradigm shift from "Big is great" to "Small is beautiful" worlds, leading to further emphasis and promotion of micro- and nano-technologies.

Completely automated workpiece loading and unloading with pneumatic system of cylinders is another important part of the system.

This matrix formulation makes it direct to write down the DE controller from standard manufacturing tools such as the bill of materials or the assembly tree. It is shown that the DE controller's matrix form equations plus the Petri Net marking transition equation together provide a complete dynamical description of DE systems. Deadlock-free dispatching rules are derived by performing circular wait analysis (CW) for possible deadlock situations. We analyze the so-called critical siphons, certain critical subsystems and resources to develop a DE controller that guaranties deadlock-free dispatching by limiting the work-in-progress in the critical subsystems associated with each CW. This is the least-restrictive dispatching policy that avoids deadlock. The deadlock-free dispatching rules are implemented by the DE controller on a three-robot, two machine reentrant flow line, the Intelligent Material Handling cell at the Automation and Robotics Research Institute of UTA.

	abstract = {Non-hierarchical regional production networks are the object of a collaborative research project carried out at Chemnitz University of Technology. Non-hierarchical production networks are created by forming a co-operation of small autonomous manufacturing units, so called competence cells. The cell's autonomy in the network model allows each cell to pursue its own agenda of production tasks. Thus a cell's agenda might be in conflict with supply requests within the network. The resolution of such conflicts requires a negotiation between client and supplier to harmonise their individual interests. Our paper proposes a software agent, capable to conduct an automated negotiation in this situation, in order to assist the human decision-maker and accelerate the harmonisation. The agent can perform an integrative negotiation about multiple interdependent properties of the supply contract, such as price, volume and delivery date. The negotiation protocol follows the offer-counteroffer principle and an adaptive offer generation strategy. However, based on the utility theory, the agent is able to create a bundle of equally good offers, each of them consisting of a particular combination of property values. By proposing more than one offer, the number of negotiation acts is reduced to a necessary minimum and the overall quality of a deal can improve. In the paper, we show the conflict resolution in the context of non-hierarchical production networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our agent model is flexible enough to be applied in supply scenarios requiring the negotiation of contracts. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The use of flax has gained significance since the 1980s and the reason for its use as a renewable raw material is the recycling and composting of of used products and textiles. However, to evaluate its machinability in the textile industry, a mechanic-technological fiber test is necessary. For a close to production test of the average fiber length of flax short fibers, a device for automated manufacturing of end-aligned flax fiber specimen was developed in the Steinbeis Transfer Centre for drive and handling technique in mechanical engineering (STZ), Chemnitz, Germany. The device consists of laying-on, feeding, and discharging area for the manually submitted tuft, and deposit, press-in, and taking out area of the removed fibers. The manually pre-arranged fiber samples were placed by hand on the laying-on pin-plate and pressed into the pin plates by hand. The pin-plate allows a laying-on width of 140 mm and ∼ length of 250 mm. By stepwise lowering the leading pin plate the fiber ends were laid free, and were pulled out from the laying-on pin-plate with a horizontal extendable gripper device. By the constant process of the fiber laydown, the necessary reference line for the evaluation is derived.},

	abstract = {A geometry and mesh transformation approach is proposed to overcome the traditional problem of poorly shaped elements at the boundary using the grid-based method of mesh generation. This is achieved by transforming the original geometric model to a topologically similar recognition model which conforms fully to the Cartesian directions. Such a recognition model is constructed by tessellating the original model and then employing a fuzzy logic method to determine the normal directions of the faces. A three-dimensional field morphing algorithm is used to position the features of the recognition model. Such a recognition model is then meshed with hexahedral elements without any degeneracy using the new grid-based algorithm. The mesh of the recognition model is mapped back to the original geometric model by employing a transformation based on the Laplacian-isoparametric equation. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {In spite of advances in industrial automation, manual assembly tasks continue to be an important feature of many industrial operations. In heavy part assembly, some pieces of raw material or equipment are too heavy to be safely handled by just one operator. Material handling devices such as Jib cranes or overhead cranes are employed to help operators work safer and, in some cases, faster. However, during full-load productions, access to these devices could become limited due to insufficient resources and hence, delay or extend the cycle times. The authors studied how people perform the assembly and subsequently applied Fitts' Index of Difficulty to develop a model which indicates factors that increase the task difficulty. This model can also be used as an assembly time predictor. Since improving the efficiency of an overhead crane could significantly reduce the total cycle times and production costs, the authors modified the crane by adding a spring between the hook and the gripper to help support the weight. Two sets of experiments were conducted. The first set was to investigate the effect of spring stiffness on assembly time. The result indicated that using a spring that was too soft could create a parasitic oscillation, which increases the assembly time. The objective of the second set was to compare the assembly time of using the regular crane to that of the modified crane in situations where the part weights and the task difficulty vary. As a result of the modifications, assembly performance tended to increase by approximately 250% from using the modified crane. Copyright © 2002 by ASME.},

This is particularly so in mass production, where automated assembly lines are increasingly common, and product uniformity is a priority. It is a fact that the main reasons for the fluctuations in part geometries are the inconsistent mechanical properties of the input material, and production engineers are often unable to influence this. Here we investigate the possibility of stabilizing the mechanical properties of wire by using a roller straightener, which is used in every wire-processing production process. At the beginning a short outline of the steel's response during cyclic straining is given. This is followed by the modeling of the wire-straightening process and by the stabilization algorithm. Finally, the model is tested on a real industrial process - the production of leverarch mechanisms for ringbinder files. © 2003 Journal of Mechanical Engineering. All rights reserved.},

During the pre-bench top era this laboratory course was offered during a summer session at the end of the freshman year. This format provided students with a common laboratory experience. However, the summer laboratory experience lacked the capacity to correlate lecture materials with actual laboratory exercises. This disjoint provided stimulus for change, and change did occur in the form of two concurrent course offerings. In response to these changes each campus location of Penn State University offering the associate degree in mechanical engineering technology was required to procure equipment for these course offerings. In conjunction with a grant received from The Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME), donor contributions, state vocational money, and matching funds from the local campus administration bench top equipment was purchased. The equipment included a CNC milling machine, a CNC lathe, a conveyor belt, gravity feeder, and a linear slide base mounted six axis robot This paper documents how the bench top equipment was arranged into a flexible manufacturing system, integrated into the laboratory course, and used for a robotics competition sponsored by SME.},

Complementary filters provide a means of fusing information from sensors with different characteristics in order to produce a more reliable estimate of the desired variable. Here, the range and bearing of landmarks observed by the vision system are fused with odometry information and a vehicle model, providing a more reliable estimate of these states.

The proposed laboratory course will be structured around four "equipment centers" represented important areas of applications in the thermal-fluid sciences: 1) Armfield Modules (turbomachinery), 2) Steam Motor and Energy Conversion Set, 3) Modular Air Flow Laboratory, and 4) Experimental Heat Pump and Air Cooler. The students will take the course after they finish courses in Thermodynamics and Fluid Mechanics. The course will give our students an opportunity to observe how the concepts and principles learned in the classroom can be applied in a practical situation. To extend the instructional capability of the equipment and to give the students knowledge of modern instrumentation and control systems we use LabVIEW for computerization and automation of this laboratory. The experiments that have already been developed for the course as well as experiments that have been planned for the future are presented in the paper.},

	abstract = {The most effective way of lowering operating costs is to employ wear- and maintenance-free technology. BMH Claudius Peters has taken this into account by developing the "Compact Swing" support of the grate and a new grate guidance system for main functions of the cooler. The wear on the grate plates can be reduced by using modern material technology. A further improvement lies in automation of the clinker cooler - any fluctuations in kiln discharge are detected immediately by direct measurement of the clinker bed depth at the cooler inlet shaft by the so-called "LevelRadar" and are then smoothed out in the cooler by the automatic grate stroke rate control. Rapid-reaction, drift-free secondary air temperature measurement improves thermal assessment of the clinker cooler. The clinker cooler is based on the aeration system, consisting of HE Module and Fishbone Aeration, which has proved successful over many years. Examples are used to demonstrate that consistent linking of process technology, mechanical engineering and control technology will lead to a reduction in operating costs. The overall plant design concept is just as important as design details of the grate plates or the support of the grate.},

All the projects regarding port infrastructures have to get through several steps before they pass to the operative phase. Firstly, an analysis of the currant situation is necessary, underlining the results to be achieved based on a predictable future situation. However, there is a long period of time between this analysis and the moment in which the project may actually get started. This long period prevents analysts from making precise predictions about what the situation will be by the time the infrastructures will be built and the information systems will be implemented. All the civil projects are defined for a 20-30 years future horizon, while the information systems and the technological features foresee a sensibly shorter life period, usually 5-7 years. Planning a new port, or the enhancement of an already existent one, that time span difference leads to a situation where new infrastructures are run with a technology level generally corresponding to a former period. As a consequence, the whole effort afforded to build a modern port system is weakened by the fact that the brand-new port is matching the future challenges using the "day-before" technology.},

	abstract = {In recent years, various automation technologies developed in engineering fields have been gaining attention from scientists and researchers to improve productivity, accuracy and quality of work in their science labs. This paper presents a unique case study of a private company sponsored project to develop a prototype of an automated liquid handling system for science labs. The device is especially intended for applications such as proteomics, oligonucleotides and high throughput screening. The system is composed of assembled syringes, pneumatic devices, linear drive, stepper motor, PLC and other miscellaneous devices. Two graduate students were involved in this project to satisfy the master's project requirement of our Mechanical Engineering curriculum. The development of the prototype was divided into two major stages. The first major stage conducted by the first graduate student consisted of requirement definition, conceptual design, modeling and simulation. The second stage conducted by the second graduate student consisted of design reviews, prototype fabrication, and testing. The project provided the students with an excellent opportunity for exposure to mechatronics technologies as well as the experience of being a part of a real-world engineering product development.},

In order to create these crystals, a source material must first be made by combining silicon and graphite and baking it at temperatures which reach 3000°C in a perfectly uncontaminated environment of argon gas. By heating the crystals in a vacuum, it is possible to reach the necessary temperatures with less lower power as compared to heating at atmospheric pressure. This paper presents the design and implementation of a vacuum furnace automation project that was done as an Electro-Mechanical Engineering Technology capstone senior design project. The automation was designed for a vacuum furnace that previously had only manual controls. The upgrade included additional instrumentation and a LabVIEW HMI for process monitoring and control, data collection, and recipe entry. This project was supervised by the Electro-Optics Center of Penn State University's Applied Research Laboratory.},

This issue relates to finding a transformation matrix between the intended and actual locations to compensate for fixturing errors before welding starts. An algorithm of 3-D position estimation using a laser vision sensor is introduced for automatic die remodeling. First, a vision sensor based on optical triangulation was used to collect the range data on die surfaces for automatic remodeling. Second, line and plane vector equations were constructed from the measured range data, and an analytic algorithm was proposed for recognizing the die location with these vector equations. This algorithm produces the transformation matrix with no specific feature points. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, a corrugated SUS plate was measured with a laser vision sensor attached to a three-axis Cartesian manipulator, and the transformation matrix was calculated.},

	abstract = {A quick look to the literature related to "Design" points out the fact that traditional fields are covered by a huge quantity of concepts and sub-topics dealing with various research fields. Some of these fields and related concepts are emerging and others are disappearing. The last two decades provided a large variations in the covered fields - probably because of the computers capacity and the knowledge sharing using the internet- We are convinced that its time now for a global understanding of the evolution of the related preoccupations in order to start a new phase that deals with the next guidelines issues in design. Many researchers and gurus have proposed evolution schemes from an epistemological point of view. However, we believe that we still need a pragmatic analysis of what have been done and what is going on now in the various publications that deals with design, conferences and journals. To do so, we present in this paper an approach that lies on the systematic analysis of the International Design Engineering Technical Conference (IDETC-ASME), the Design Conference, the Integrated Design and Manufacturing in Mechanical Engineering (IDMME) and the International Conference in Engineering Design (ICED). We also consider the major reviews and journals related to design such as Computer-Aided Design, Journal of mechanical design and many others. Our proposition, presents a global overview that shows the time-evolution of the topics, the density production, the emerging areas and concepts. We show then that some topics remain with a great interest and other are in a decreasing period. A specific study of what is going on within the Design Automation Conference is provided and an open discussion is started.},

The first prototype end-effector, designed for U.S. Postal Service, has two rollers. The rollers are pushed toward each other by the force of a spring. When the rollers are powered to spin, the inward spinning of the rollers causes the sack material to be dragged in between the rollers due to the friction between the surfaces of the rollers and the sack material. The spring pushes the rollers toward each other with sufficient force to hold the sack material in place between the rollers.

The required force and degree of precision needed were thought to be within the capabilities of a pneumatically actuated robot. This would keep the cost of the apparatus down, which was important given the low capital cost of the manual operation. Furthermore, given that manipulation of the air pressure is the mechanism used to move a pneumatic actuator, the combined control of force and position is inherent to the system. A number of different pneumatic circuit configurations were examined before adopting a design that uses a combination of directional solenoid and flow control valves controlled by a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). Pressure transducers and analog linear potentiometers are used for data acquisition.

	abstract = {A key issue in developing new intelligent computer aided design and manufacturing tools (CAD/CAM) is knowledge representation. Engineering knowledge has been represented in many forms, such as rule sets, design procedures, features, frames, and semantic networks. Some of these are domain dependent, some are query dependent, and some require specialized inferencing engines or solving algorithms, thus providing a severe limitation for exchange and re-use of design knowledge. A standard representation structure that is capable of encapsulating different types of knowledge would be a useful tool. The design exemplar provides a standard representation of mechanical engineering design problem knowledge based upon a canonically derived set of entities and relationships. The data structure of the design exemplar facilitates four basic design tasks: pattern matching, property extraction, design validation, and change propagation. This paper shows that it is possible to map the design exemplar to other representations (procedures, rules, and features). The concept of integrating atomic design exemplars into composite networks for performing complex design tasks is also introduced as a tool for developing and applying the design exemplar in engineering design automation.

	abstract = {Electronics manufacturers face a unique challenge in attempting to manage a stream of used goods of different value to meet uncertain demands for reused products or recycled materials. In current systems, items are processed and stored manually and high inventories are often maintained. High volumes of used goods necessitate automated solutions to the sorting and dismantling tasks. A new approach is presented for prototyping demanufacturing cell automation using lean principles. Prototyping of the automation is based on value definition, used good value stream mapping, flow, "pull", and continuous improvement. Therefore, the demanufacturing cell automation is optimized to provide the demanufacturer the maximum "value" in the least amount of time from a used product stream. A prototype demanufacturing cell is proposed based on the comparison of feasible automation strategies for demanufacturing strategy includes the specification of configuration of manipulators, sensors, and material handling devices in the work cell as well as a processing method such as partially destructive disassembly. The prototyping methodology is illustrated with a case study for demanufacturing cell phones. Conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the prototyping methodology are presented and areas for future investigation are identified. © 2003 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A method to design slider-crank mechanisms to achieve multi-phase path and function generation applications typically accomplished by adjustable planar four-bar mechanisms is presented. The benefit of this method is twofold. First, multiple phases of prescribed coupler curve points or crank and follower displacement angles are achievable using a mechanism with fewer moving parts than the planar four-bar mechanism. Second, the slider-crank mechanism can achieve these phases of prescribed values without any physical or automated adjustments of its moving pivots between phases. A slider path that enables the slider-crank to achieve two phases of prescribed coupler curve points or crank and follower displacement angles is designed by using seventh order polynomials to connect the moving pivot paths of the follower link of the adjustable planar four-bar mechanism. This polynomial generates smooth radial displacement, velocity, acceleration and jerk profiles with boundary conditions that can be prescribed. The example problems in this work considers a two-phase moving pivot adjustment of a planar four-bar mechanism. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paper discusses the similarities and differences between design problem complexity, design process complexity, and design artifact complexity. Three fundamental aspects to complexity are identified: the size, the degree of coupling, and the solvability. Alternative methods for measuring these characteristics of the design are discussed based upon computational views of complexity, information based views of complexity, and traditional design views of complexity. A method of measuring size as it relates to complexity is proposed for measuring the information content of design. A second method is proposed for decomposing a graph-based representation of design that provides a measure of the interconnectedness as it relates to complexity. Finally, two methods are proposed for determining the solvability complexity of design based upon the effort involved and the degree of freedom of design. These measures are developed specifically for parametric and geometric problems as found in embodiment design.},

	abstract = {Reliability analysis will have a major influence on the design, if it is applied during the conceptual design phase. This will result in more reliable and less expensive structures; a structure that is reliable in concept is less expensive than a structure that is not reliable in concept, but is improved in a later phase of the design process. The introduction of reliability analysis in the conceptual design phase will have important consequences for the design process. The designer and risk analyst would have to work closely together and the risk analyst has to make fault tree analyses for many design solutions, increasing the cost of the design. Automation can make the analysis less complex, can reduce the time of an analysis, and can prevent errors. An implementation in software can take over complex parts of the analysis from the designer and risk analyst, and it can execute these tasks much faster and more accurate. If the designer can execute the analysis himself, he does not depend on the availability of a risk analysis expert. Then, he can immediately decide if and how the design needs improvement. Also, the designer can optimise a structure by analysing a number of concepts. Thus, reliability analysis can be applied in many more cases than before, which will lead to better designs. This article discusses the role of reliability analysis in the design process of drive systems at the Mechanical Engineering Department of the Construction Division of the Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management. It gives an abstract description of the functions of a drive system to find an automated reliability analysis method. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We have added the generation of finite element models to the previously built Unigraphics Version 16 (UG V16) parametric model, so that finite element models could be quickly built. UG/WAVE was used to design the vehicle parametrically and UG/SCENARIO, a pre- and post-processor integrated in UG, was used to automatically construct the finite element mesh. We established the quality of the finite element meshes, generated for two new designs, which were created by changing overall dimensions of the vehicle. This was done using objective criteria for the finite element mesh. The component data was added to the automatically generated mesh, and the results from the crashworthiness analysis of this model compared favorably with the 'hand-built' model using traditional model building techniques. The results from this work will be useful in the development of the parametric design process. The use of automatically generated finite element meshes will also be useful for the automated evaluation of these parametric designs. Copyright © 2002 by ASME.},

	abstract = {In spite of the recent advancements in wafer fabrication techniques, devices are still being individually checked and modified. This is due to the fact that the general manufacturing processes involved in wafer production have their inherent inconsistencies. As a consequence, individual devices show differences in characteristics that would render a big group of them operating out of the range of the pre-set spec limits. Therefore they would require types of modifications specific to the individual device. Knowing that the resources spent on checking and eliminating out-of-spec devices before they reach the customer are very significant, the manufacturing operation becomes hardly profitable. These wafers normally carry devices in the range of a thousand or so, making a statistical approach very attractive. In this paper, an actual industrial problem in wafer fabrication to the desired specifications is presented. The problem shows in passive filters built using Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) theory. A solution considering a statistical process control approach to the population of devices on the wafer is proposed. The results of applying this solution are realized in significant product yield increase, huge cost cutting, and automation promotion and application. Copyright © 2002 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Two years ago, the federal government helped organize and fund the Next-Generation Manufacturing (NGM) Project, an elaborate effort to forecast manufacturing business conditions for the next 10 to 15 years. The key drivers of change according to the NGM study team were the following: ubiquitous availability and distribution of information using greatly improved computer and communications systems. Accelerating pace of change in technology. Due to continued automation, manufacturing labor is projected to decrease by about 1 million jobs over the next decade. Rapidly expanding technology access. As technological and scientific education spreads worldwide, competitive advantage no longer depends solely on superior technology and expertise. The current large differentials in technical skills among nations are shrinking. Globalization of markets and business competition. Global wage and job skills shifts. Many job skills will become 'commodities' bringing wage scales for traditional skills in the United States down to the world-market level. Environmental responsibility and resource limitations. Increasing customer expectations.},

A nationwide study of the TAC/ABET accredited Mechanical Engineering Technology programs was conducted to determine the amount of curriculum diversification, the depth of study, and the popularity of the various topics of study. The Internet was used to gather the curriculum for all of the eighteen programs that were found. The diversity of topics and the depth of study in these topics was determined. Twenty topics were identified. Some topics were very much more popular than others with several topics not available in the majority of programs. Considerable diversity existed in the number of topics and the total hours taught in various programs.},

For multiple automated guided vehicle (AGV) systems, we embed a simple rule and introduce a push-AGV strategy in a TPPN model to solve the collision and traffic jam problems of vehicles. Since a firing sequence of the TPPN from the initial marking to the final marking can be seen as a schedule of the modeled FMS, by using an A * based search algorithm, namely, Limited-Expansion A algorithm, an effective schedule of the part processing can be obtained. To show the promising potential of the proposed work, a prototype FMS in Automation Laboratory of Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Taiwan University, is used as a target system for implementation. The experiment results assert that the job-shop scheduling problem can always be satisfactorily solved. © 1994 IEEE},

	abstract = {The ability to easily monitor the rate of cell growth has many useful applications such as characterizing cell lines to optimize growth conditions and compound screening to test for cytotoxicity. As a cell growth sensor, the ultrasonic flexural plate-wave device offers a convenient assay that is non-invasive, continuous, and capable of full automation for high throughput screening. The flexural plate-wave (FPW) device is a microfabricated sensor consisting of a thin silicon nitride membrane with aluminum and zinc oxide transducers at both ends. These interdigitated transducers send and receive acoustic plate waves that propagate along the membrane. Applications of the device include mass sensing, achieved by measuring the frequency shift caused by mass loading of the membrane, and pumping of liquids and gases. We have conducted studies that established the biocompatibility of the FPW device materials with cell cultures. In addition, biological samples were exposed to the ultrasonic agitation of the device and no damaging effects were found. Experiments were performed using the FPW device to sense cell growth for mammalian suspension (non- adherent) cells. Results show a good correlation between change of cell number and frequency. ©2004 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.},

The formation of the microstructures during heat treatment induce stresses, which interact with the stresses present in the components. The physical properties are microstructure and temperature dependent properties.

	abstract = {Welding has traditionally been regarded as a subbranch of metallurgy. Consequently, welding research results are not routinely reported at mechanical engineering and manufacturing conferences. However, welding and joining processes encompass a much broader group of disciplines in both mechanical engineering and materials science. Recent developments in welding and jointing process that are related to automation have linked these processes to yet other disciplines such as expert systems, sensors, and controls. There is a need for closer interaction between researchers in these fields and those in other disciplines of mechanical engineering and manufacturing. It is with the foregoing in mind that this session was conceived. The session is aimed to foster a closer relationship between welding and joining process engineers and the mechanical engineering as well as manufacturing communities at large. It would bring together leading researchers in the areas of sensors and signal processing for weld process monitoring, process modelling and control, expert systems, and process automation to discuss issues related to future trends in advanced and intelligent welding systems.},

	abstract = {Computational analysis has become an essential tool for the evaluation of designs for complex engineering products, and engineers are using more analysis applications to model a wider range of product behaviour than ever before. Existing technology is unable to offer effective solutions for the management and integration of either the applications themselves or the information they use and create. This is in part due to an inadequate understanding of the engineering analysis process. In order to facilitate the construction of more automated analysis systems with reduced dependence on specialized data formats, it is necessary to better understand how existing analysis applications use and generate information and what their common (and hence potentially shareable) elements are. We present a discussion of the concepts of computational analysis and its use within the engineering design process. The design of gas turbine rotor blades is used to illustrate the wide range of analyses that need to be supported within mechanical engineering, and analyses for the calculation of stress and strain values for these blades are used to exemplify the roles of the primary concepts involved. © 1995 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

The approach to recognition of the drawings which are noisy and degraded and where some of the components are connected together is also discussed.

	abstract = {Recently, the importance of system design in the field of mechanical engineering has been increasingly recognized. However suitable and useful methods for machine design are not yet established. An analytical method of the dynamic characteristics in the mechanical system, a method utilizing linear graph theory, is proposed. In this paper, for practical use of this analytical method, a program is developed which can analyze the dynamic characteristics automatically. As an example, in the mechanical vibration system, with the arrangement of the elements on the computer display, the system graph and the equations of motion are automatically produced by means of a cut-set matrix, and the dynamic characteristics of the system are derived by means of a computer algebraic method. © 1993, The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.

	abstract = {Engineering drawings on paper have several disadvantages; they require a large storage space, are subject to deterioration, and are difficult to reuse. Several systems have been proposed to convert drawings to computer data. Most of them, however, rely on simple bottom-up algorithms and are very time-consuming because they must depend on human intervention for resolving recognition bottlenecks. Here, an automatic recognition system of mechanical engineering drawings for this paper-CAD conversion is proposed. It utilizes an enhanced bottom-up scheme for component recognition and a top-down scheme to identify valid component structures. Processing units are realized as individual experts and are integrated using a blackboard data system. This structure makes the proposed system robust to both noise and variations of drawings format and allows parallel implementation. Experimental results show that the system works well on the drawings with connected elements such as character strings and dimension lines. © 1994, The Japan Society for Precision Engineering.

Although the Electric Discharge Machining (EDM) process has been around for more than fifty years, it has seen tremendous growth in application in the recent years. Electric Discharge Wire Cutting (EDWC) which works on the same principle as EDM, is a relatively new-comer in the manufacturing arena. There are several application areas related to EDWC that have not been addressed. These problem areas offer excellent opportunities for jointly sponsored applied research projects. This paper describes a project for the design and development of an automated EDWC machining station for cutting small tubes. The project was done under a joint grant from the Center for Innovative Technology of the state of Virginia and a local industry.},

The system is designed to distinguish between and recirculate steel balls of three different sizes (7/32 inches, 1/4 inches, 9/32 inches). Inputs and outputs of the system were examined and the appropriate ladder logic was developed. This ladder logic acts as the main control for the system, however the PLC features a data highway which was used to interface our pick and place device to a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) software and develop a man-machine interface (MMI). During the development of this module, students were exposed to a series of different fields, from the mechanical design of the system, wiring of the set-up, implementation of the ladder logic and development of the man-machine interface.},

	abstract = {There is a need in industry for technology graduates who can use a combination of electrical and mechanical concepts in the design, installation, and service of products and production systems. Preparing Associate Degree graduates for this role is difficult because four semesters is too short for extensive education in both disciplines. Penn State Altoona Campus addressed this problem by: 1) modifying three courses offered at the Associate Degree level to include concepts that bridge the two technologies; and 2) introducing a new four-year degree program, Bachelor of Science in Electro-Mechanical Engineering Technology (BSEMET), in the Fall, 1994, semester. The solution to the training problem created two major pedagogical problems. The first problem was to properly deliver the interdisciplinary content in the three modified courses. While the courses covered both product design and production system design and had a mix of electrical and mechanical concepts, there was no effort to use the same product examples in all three courses. The second problem was teaching standard 16 student laboratory sections with single production machines and integrated manufacturing systems. This paper proposes two initiatives that would overcome the instructional delivery problems associated with cross training in electro-mechanical concepts and the use of large automated manufacturing systems in traditional laboratory sections. These initiatives involve: 1) the integration of a product design problem into manufacturing courses; 2) the development of a laboratory environment that permits standard laboratory class sizes of 16 students to effectively use single production machines and integrated manufacturing systems. The second problem is significant because many colleges add manufacturing systems to laboratories but few address the training issues associated with integrated manufacturing systems hardware in standard laboratory sections.},

The methods proposed in [1] involve the use of empirical factors. Considering the complex formulae and computation required, the authors have decided to employ the centroid solid angle concept to predict the natural resting behaviour of a part. The method presented here is the centroid angle concept which assumes that the probability of any surface of a part on which it comes to rest, is directly proportional to the difference between the centroid solid angle of that aspect and the average of the critical solid angles of the neighbouring aspects, and inversely proportional to the height of the centre of gravity of that aspect. The results showed that the predicted data agree well with both the experimental data obtained in [1] and the authors. This is the first successful attempt at the analysis of the natural behaviour of a part on a hard surface without resorting to empirical factors.},

	abstract = {Using a new methodology - hybrid method to couple nonlinear gross motion and linear elastic deformation for dynamic stress computation and local strain approach for life prediction, the fatigue life of a large scale, spatial mechanism that contain complex-shaped, flexible bodies can be solved. The process is concerned with multidisciplines and various computer-Aided-Engineering (CAE) tools, and it also consumes computer time. In order to make some sense in reality and reducing the time required for a design cycle, an advanced computer simulation technology, which carries out an integrated CAE environment for computing dynamic stress time histories and predicting fatigue life using this methodology is presented in this paper. This system is a flexible, general purposed, integrated CAE environment. The objective of the system is to provide a layer of network computational services for reliable remote computations, and data transfers between an engineering workstation and a computation server on a high speed computer. It incorporates the strong points of both engineering and a computer to solve an engineering problem by simulation, automation, reliability, and high speed. The final goal is to predict fatigue life of complex mechanical systems using dynamic stress histories that are computed by the system. The system integrates many CAE tools for the purpose of helping the engineers analyze and design components of multibody mechanical systems. So the system is a conceptual framework that collects various CAE tools and specifies how engineers are to operate and interact with these tools. This paper describes the approach taken in the system to perform the dynamic stress computation and fatigue life prediction. Two examples have been executed for verifying the feasibility of this system. Significance of this system has also been shown in this paper through these examples.},

A comparative examination of modern automated teller machines (ATMs) and electronic banking systems alongside the mechanical machines in use less than half a century ago illustrates how this rapid introduction of advances technology has been made possible through the interaction of mechanical engineering (especially mechanisms), electronic actuators and sensors, and computer software, and activity which has become known as 'mechatronics'. This paper describes the evolution of the modern ATM, highlighting the interdisciplinary engineering skills that are necessary to achieve the performance goals of speed, reliability, security and user-friendliness.},

	abstract = {Natural Chemical Additives have played an important role at the raw material preparation stage since the earliest beginnings of handmade papermaking more than two thousand years ago. Up until the end of the Eighteenth Century, naturally occurring Chemical Additives were used to increase the strength of paper, to generate better writing and printing characteristics, to enhance its brightness and to colour it. With the invention of the paper machine, chemicals began to contribute to industrial papermaking processes. It was only when newly developed bleaching chemicals came to be used creatively that the full range of possibilities offered by wood pulp as a new source of raw material could be exploited to the full. Sizing and dyeing at the wet end were a prerequisite for the increasing automation of the papermaking process. The enhanced quality that could be obtained by using functional Chemical Additives made a large contribution to the growth of the paper industry in the first half of the Twentieth Century. The past fifty years have been characterized by the increased use of waste paper and fillers, higher productivity, and an emphasis on economics, ecology and quality. These achievements have largely been made possible by the development of a wide variety of Chemical Additives and their associated benefits from intelligent application. Up until now, most new innovations in the paper industry have been in the field of mechanical engineering, but future developments will depend mainly on the total chemistry of the papermaking process. It is only by using Chemical Additives that papermakers will be able strongly differentiate of their paper qualities and obtain greater added value from optimizing the production processes. The levels of synthetic Chemical Additives used in world-wide paper production have increased from 0.3% to 1% as a proportion of paper tonnage over the past fifty years. In spite of their relatively low level of addition. Chemical Additives offer papermakers significant advantages in terms of productivity, cost effectiveness, quality and ecology. The growth in the proportion of Chemical Additives contained in paper will slow down over the next twenty years, because of greater efficiency and greater technical expertise in applying them. Assuming a growth rate of 2.5% for paper production, consumption of Chemical Additives however increases from the current level of 3 million tonnes/year to 6 million tonnes/year in the year 2020. The major contribution will come from the growing demand for synthetic binders, coating additives, sizing agents, dry strength resins and new functional molecules such as polyvinylamine. In order to meet the requirements of paper manufacturers and to achieve further progress in papermaking and paper coating the chemical industry must devote considerable resources to research, development, applications technology and capital investment for sufficient product capacities. For this extensive commitment the chemical industry must obtain an appropriate return on investment which can only come from the paper industry.},

Formerly, hardwired NC controllers largely required programming away from the shopfloor, whereas modern CNC technology can be operated with various types of shopfloor programming. With regard to a number of surveys carried out in the German mechanical engineering industry in recent years, different forms of work organizations with CNC machine tools can be seen. One can roughly differentiate between 'centralistic' and 'shopfloor-oriented' strategies. The reasons for alternative forms of work organization can be found first in technical and economic factors, and second, the type of work organization selected by firms for the use of CNC machine tools is to a large extent determined by social and political factors. © 1993.},

Coupled with automation, it will drastically reduce the cost of microequipment. This in its turn will reduce the cost of micromechanical devices manufactured by microequipment. Microequipment-based manufacturing will also increase throughput by the concurrent operation of large numbers of low-cost microequipment pieces. The low cost and high productivity of microequipment-based manufacturing will widen the range of feasible micromechanical applications, both single-unit and mass. We propose designs for microvalve fluid filters, capillary heat exchangers, electromagnetic and hydraulic step motors that could be easily implemented by micromechanical engineering technologies. Hybrid technologies combining massively parallel microequipment based manufacturing and batch manufacturing may also be promising.},

While the automation techniques used by central Pennsylvania companies varies, they have some common elements: a high degree of distributed control and increased use of programmable logic controllers and electro-mechanical devices. In addition, many companies require technology graduates to work on applied engineering problems. As a result of the these changes, the Engineering Department at PennState University Altoona Campus added a Bachelor of Science degree in Electro-mechanical Engineering Technology (BSEMET). An automation laboratory in a new Automation Technology Center was added to support three new controls courses taught in the last year of the BSEMET program. The development of the controls laboratory presented some unique problems. The laboratory was required to support a standard laboratory class size of 16 students while delivering laboratory training over a wide range of manufacturing control problems. A laboratory system was required that permitted eight teams of two students each to have equal access to control and operation exercises on the single large manufacturing system. At the same time the laboratory system had to support fundamental control exercises on single machines and trainers. This paper describes the development of a controls laboratory system that permits student laboratory groups the opportunity to develop unique solutions for single large system trainers in the context of the standard laboratory class size.},

	abstract = {Most consumer or commercial electronic products are electromechanical systems consisting of mechanical components such as structures, enclosures, drying systems and mechanisms, combined with electrical components such as printed circuit boards (PCBs), power supply, wires (harness) and switches. The design of such multidisciplinary products involves high coordination and cooperation between the two different engineering fields of mechanical and electrical design. However, in spite of the advancements of CAD tool development in design automation technology within each field, a gap still exists for good communication between the designers in these two fields during the course of the design. This gap makes the design process of such products time-consuming and error prone. This paper describes a research effort that facilitates multidisciplinary concurrent design for consumer electronic products. The focus is on how to integrate mechanical and electrical CAD tools into a more flexible and extensible concurrent design environment to share and communicate critical design information during the design process. A multidisciplinary concurrent design environment based on the CAD framework concept is described. Approaches for integrating the design data and information in such a multidisciplinary design environment are discussed. A prototyping system for the concurrent design of consumer electronic products is also presented.},

	abstract = {The Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) design process for a facility involves participation of many design specialists. These participants are architects, engineers (structural, mechanical and electrical) and contractors, who may be independent design professionals or design teams within an organization. From the viewpoint of information processing, two characteristic features distinguish the AEC design process from many other design domains. Firstly, there is a massive volume of design data involved in the design of each of its component specialties. Secondly, the specialization of the disciplines themselves warrant substantial autonomy. For design automation, this autonomy should be realized without sacrificing the collaborative nature of the multidisciplinary AEC design process. We propose autonomous AEC databases to deal with the first issue, and a global constraint maintenance mechanism for the second. Autonomous design databases can support the existing local applications in architectural, structural and mechanical engineering, and construction domains. However, a set of inter-disciplinary constraints needs to be enforced to ensure spatial and functional consistency of the design. A global constraint checking mechanism frees designers from the burden of keeping track of various design changes that may result in cross-functional conflicts. In this paper, we discuss the relevant issues for constraint management on distributed AEC databases. Although specific AEC examples will be used, the presentation is general enough to be applicable to other design domains, such as VLSI and manufacturing. © 1994 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

Fixturing involves the workholding components and the associated planning that must be done to properly position and finally clamp a part. In the past, part setup and clamping problems have been dealt with as a craft: human expert machinists, after an accumulation of many years of experience, derive part process planning strategies in a reasonable amount of time. This paper describes work that aims to create a science base for clamping: distinct patterns have been discovered that characterize how expert machinists plan setups and clamp parts. A core set of tradeoffs employed by the experts to clamp and machine parts has been established, and these tradeoffs are parameterized by models based on first principles of mechanical engineering and experimental results. Knowledge based planning methods of template matching, feature interaction guide selection, and attribute value approximation have been identified. The craftmen's knowledge based methods and the analytical tradeoffs are integrated to form setup and workholding guides within a hierarchical framework. © 1988.},

An important role is being played in this area by the Research Institute of Engineering Technology and Economics (VUSTE), Prague, which elaborates and co-ordinates significant projects of the state technical policy in the field of flexible automation. Theoretical approaches are being gradually verified in practical life with 40 automated manufacturing systems in operation. The paper discusses findings accumulated in the elaboration and construction of selected automated flexible manufacturing systems designed by the Institute. Attention is also paid to the co-operation with the CMEA member countries in this field.},

	abstract = {The push to get products to market faster has generated a great deal of interest in the concept of concurrent or simultaneous engineering. In this approach, issues that traditionally were addressed once the design was complete - materials, safety, maintainability, manufacturability, and cost - are now being considered right from the start. The major benefit of concurrent engineering is dramatically shortened production cycles. Software suppliers have devised closer interfaces between CAD and CAM, making the transfer of geometric data between the two much faster and easier. Modern tools must be compatible with a more flexible approach to manufacturing, and hard automation, the rule just a few years ago, is giving way to the concept of more modular, flexible systems. The computer numerical control (CNC) is connected to all the modules with simple single-wire serial communications. This allows a user to quickly assemble complex, customized systems from standard machines. Modern CNCs make more use of on-screen displays and provide new ways for the users to interact with them.},

In any case, says Seering, replacing factory-floor labor is only a small part of the factory automation.

When knowledge-based expert rules, equations, and proprietary languages extend CAD/CAM software, previously designed mechanisms can be scaled to satisfy new design requirements in the shortest time. Two major drawbacks exist in current technology. First, embedded design alternatives needed by design engineers during the product conception and rework stages are lacking. Second, an operator is required who has a thorough understanding of the intended design and the how-to expertise needed to create and optimize the design alternatives. The focus of our research and development was to automate the intellectual operations; e.g., questioning, identifying, selecting, and coordinating the design process. A robust system emerged which: 1. Selects the best mechanisms necessary to design a power transmission device from proven solutions. 2. Aids the inexperienced operator in developing complex design solutions. 3. Provides design alternatives which add back-to-the-drawing-board capabilities to knowledge-based mechanical power transmission CAD programs. © 1990 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Through a framework, a user can invoke and manage tools, create, organize and manage data, graphically view the entire design process, and perform design data management tasks, such as configuration and version control. The CAD Framework Initiative (CFI) was founded 'to create a free market model for Electronic Design Automation tools and their supporting framework environments, via development of effective industry industry guidelines that remove barriers to integration'. While CFI's current focus is in electronic circuit design, many of the member companies need frameworks spanning multiple engineering disciplines for the complete product life-cycle. CFI is working with standards organizations in other engineering disciplines to develop a unified approach to frameworks to ensure that they will operate together. CFI welcomes the participation of companies and individuals interested in multiple discipline engineering.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new method of optimal design that combines ideas and techniques from both the Method of Optimal Design (MOD) and monotonicity analysis. This new method, while presently limited to constrained monotonic problems, has been automated. The problem is first reduced in size and reformulated using ideas from MOD. The reduced problem is then repeatedly reformulated to develop state and design equations in terms of all possible variable partitions. The complete set of candidate optimal solution points is extracted by monotonicity analysis applied to the trivial constraint sets on the design equations from every possible formulation of the problem. These candidate solution points can then be numerically sorted to determine the optimal solution for a particular numerical case. The new method and its automation are illustrated with two example problems from the literature.},

This is because the nature of mechanical devices is such that a change in some geometric characteristic of the product may result in significant changes in function and fabrication requirements. In contrast, a layout change of a VLSI circuit is likely to have a far less significant impact on function and fabrication. These function-form-fabrication relations are directly related to the complexity of the design task and to some important product characteristics such as modularity, adjustability and reliability. Strategies for decoupling or decomposing these relations are employed in design automation systems for circuits, structures and processes. Unfortunately these strategies are not always appropriate or applicable in mechanical design. Broadly applicable representations of function, form and fabrication and the associated relationships among these representations may facilitate advances in mechanical design automation.},

This concept is found to be suitable for hydraulics and pneumatics. The system structure of this system is discussed at the levels of programming, control, communication and hardware and the specifications of the Independent Intelligent Actuator are given. The practical implementation of the Independent Intelligent Actuator and the in-machine communication are also discussed and subsequently some experimental results on the areas of controlling and communication are shown.

	abstract = {This paper deals with small and medium sized firms. Since the late seventies small and medium sized mechanical engineering firms in France have resorted increasingly to new technologies, and in particular to numerical control. Numerical control has introduced major changes in work organization. On the one hand it tends to reinforce the role of methods of production engineering whatever the type of numerical control may be. Programming is seldom left to the machine operators, except in the case of straightforward machining operations or in machining shops with a strong tradition of highly skilled or artisan labour. Numerical control, on the other hand, does provide more opportunity for collaboration between the workshop and the production engineers. On a workshop level it introduces a more mobile division of labour between programmers, machine setters and operators, which covers everything from the start-up of programs to the supervision of maching operations. The operator may therefore acquire new skills, but this is only possible if there are open-ended training systems available to facilitate the transmission of know-how from the programmers to the machine setters and from the machine setters to the operators, and vice versa. Small and medium sized firms would appear to have a special role to play in developing skills. © 1986.},

	abstract = {Structural alloys used in high temperature applications exhibit complex thermomechanical behavior that is inherently time-dependent and hereditary, in the sense that current behavior depends not only on current condition but on thermomechanical history. Considerable attention is now being focused on metal matrix composite materials that, in addition, possess strong directional characteristics. In high temperature application these materials exhibit all the complexities of conventional alloys (e.g., creep, relaxation, recovery, rate sensitivity, etc.) and, in addition, their strong initial anisotropy adds further complexities. Derivation of constitutive equations which describe their behavior is very time-consuming and involves complicated lengthy expressions. Thus, the automation of the derivation process becomes crucial for further development of new theories. A computerized package, running under MACSYMA, capable of deriving potential based constitutive models, in analytical form, involving tensors, of order one (vectors) and higher, partial differentiation, invariants and the like is presented. Problem-oriented algorithms are designed and implemented.},

	abstract = {The findings presented on the employment of CAD in West Germany's mechanical engineering industry show that CAD is used in various ways by different firms and, thus, also has diverse results on working conditions. The various production structures used by the single-piece, half-standardized, and standardized series producers are considered to be the most important factors for explaining this circumstance. In addition, however, the influence of various interest groups in the firms concerning the introduction process also has to be stressed.In view of their research findings, the authors argue against using the oversimplifications and rash generalizations regarding the reduction of personnel, Taylorism, and deskilling that dominated the discussion during the early days of CAD. They regard the changes taking place at the level of the “microstructures” of designing to be basically the general consequences of the employment of CAD. These changes have until the present had little influence on the division of labor and the development of skills.The latter depend, according to the findings presented in this paper, on the various concepts of CAD utilization. Among other things, the following trends were discovered in this respect: • within the field of design, skilled jobs retain their skill level;• some already deskilled jobs disappear; • the traditional three-way task split into design, detail design, and draftsmen is developing towards a two-way split into design and draftsmen; in addition, new jobs are being created for CAD experts in the fields of CAD development and support;• stress is becoming a more important issue for the technicians; • traditional, internal career ladders are losing ground; • computerized monitoring and control threaten to introduce new ways of binding the design personnel into the design process. © 1989 IEEE},

While the development of faster and more powerful solid modellers is important, it is becoming more critical to make effective use of solid modelling in application areas. The use of solid modelling in manufacturing is an important application. Among many other questions, manufacturing engineers ask whether or not a certain geometric model stored in the computer is manufacturable or machinable? This paper presents some ideas on this question. A new concept of the Machinable Model is introduced for the boundary representation (B-rep) modeller.},

Researchers in mechanical engineering and artificial intelligence have studied the methodology of design for several years, but so far, only a small portion of the design process is sufficiently well-understood to be capable of automation. In the following two subsections, we review the models of design that have been developed in mechanical engineering artificial intelligence. This is followed by a summary of the shortcomings and open questions posed by this work. Then, we describe a pilot project that we have undertaken to develop an improved model of the design process based on data concerning the real-world behavior of mechanical designers.},

	abstract = {An observational study was conducted on a mechanical engineer throughout his task of defining the functional specifications for the machining operations of a factory automation cell. The engineer described his activity as following a hierarchically structured plan. The actual activity is in fact opportunistically organized. The engineer follows his plan as long as it is cognitively cost-effective. As soon as other actions are more interesting, he abandons his plan to proceed to these actions. This paper analyses when and how these alternative-to-the-plan actions come up. Quantitative results are presented with regard to the degree of plan deviation, the design components and the definitional aspects which are most affected by these deviations, and the deviation patterns. Qualitative results concern their nature. An explanatory framework for plan deviation is proposed in the context of a blackboard model. Plan deviation is supposed to occur if the control, according to certain selection criteria, selects an alternative-to-the-planned-action proposal rather than the planned action proposal. Implications of these results for assistance tools are discussed briefly. © 1990 Academic Press Limited.},

Multiple requirements are handled by organizing relevant evaluation, generation and choice knowledge around individual requirements and providing each requirement with the capability to determine when it has a contribution to make, what that contribution should be, and how it interacts with other requirements. The methodology has been implemented as part of the MOSAIC project and is illustrated by examples of the automated preliminary design of mechanical structures.},

It was recognized that for reducing costs in mechanical engineering tasks and to stay competitive in the industry, these tasks had to be automated. Previously these tasks used labor intensive manual design and drafting methods, and structural modelling with batch processing. Trade-off evaluations and vendor surveys were conducted of several automated drafting and structural modelling systems. The decisions made after the evaluations was to use currently available soft-ware and Tektronix terminal equipment for inter-active communications with host computers. This paper discusses how mechanical design, and structural modelling and analyses have been automated at EOSC using inter-active graphics and time-share terminals. © 1980 ACM.},

In each phase, the designer is able to determine quickly angular accelerations of members and to evaluate the forces of inertia to be added to those directly applied from outside for the structural design of a machine.},
