	abstract = {Research into Arabic Aspect Category Detection (ACD), a subtask of Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is primarily focused on experimenting with Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models, but rarely consider methods for robust dataset creation or augmentation. Therefore, this study investigates and compares two applications of AraBERT vr2 on the Arabic SemEval2016 hotel dataset, where the objective is to predict aspect categories in the reviews. The baseline pipeline uses the AraBERT classification layer to predict 34 aspect categories, and the proposed pipeline performs a data augmentation process prior to classification, where the HARD dataset is used with a Word2Vec model to extend the original training of the SemEval2016 dataset. Both implementations of AraBERT were evaluated on Gold Standard dataset derived from SemEval2016. Results indicate that both applications achieved a closely similar f1-score of 0.663 for the baseline and 0.661 for the augmented model. The by-class results are further discussed.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Sentiment analysis has become one of the most active research areas in natural language processing, and the Arabic language retains its importance in this field. It is so because of the increased use of Arabic on the internet that pushes many users to share their views or thoughts about certain products and services. Despite its crucial importance, most of the existing Arabic sentiment analysis studies have been performed on document or sentence levels with little attention to the aspect level. However, the aspect level’s main objective, also known as aspect-based sentiment analysis, is to extract the discussed aspects and identify their related sentiment polarities from a given review or text. The result is to provide more detailed information than general sentiment analysis. Therefore, this paper seeks to provide a comprehensive review of the Arabic aspect-based sentiment analysis studies and highlights the main challenges that face the different proposed approaches. The relevant gaps in the current literature and the future research directions in this area are also discussed. This survey can guide future researchers who want to contribute to the improvement of this domain. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {The paper addresses invectives as a specific phenomenon in Arabic and proposes a classification of the Arabic invective vocabulary. Defining invec-tives as a specific phenomenon, the author refers to linguistic works by V. Zhel-vis, K. Brinev, K. Allen and K. Burridge, as well as to politeness-centered studies by G. Leech and P. Brown & S. Levinson. Analyzing the nature of the invective the author argues that its defining feature is its direct association with the emotional damage it inflicts on the hearer. In chime with the corresponding references found in Arabic dictionaries such as Almaany Dictionary and A. Al-Manshawi’s Dictionary of Egyptian Swearing, this idea opens a way for further classification of the invective vocabulary in Arabic. With this goal in mind, after an overview of the existing approaches to swearword classification in Arabic proposed by A. Montagu, G. Hughes, S. Pinker, M. Ljung, V. Zhelvis and other researchers, the author puts forward his own view on the invective vocabulary typology. It is based on treating concepts not as lexemes but as units of sense, i.e. sort of ‘containers’, each incorporating a set of various meanings. From this perspective, invective concepts make the basic level of the proposed classifica-tion, while the other two levels are that of thematic groups (the concepts’ organiza-tional level), and the level of ‘sense containers’ comprising all the lexemes linked to the concepts existing on the basic level. This structure makes it possible to orga-nize the classification in the most convenient way on the one hand, and effectively adapt it to the constantly changing linguistic realia on the other. At the same time, this approach does not exclude other possibilities for a sys-tematization of the Arabic invective vocabulary. Apart from the concept-based typol-ogy above, the paper identifies other grounds for swearword classification, including based on the taboo/ allowed status of lexemes, or on the ability/inability of lexemes to express direct offense. © В.

	abstract = {Background: There has been a drastic increase in the prevalence of obesity and its related diseases in the Arabic-speaking countries during the last decades along with a lack of public awareness about this awareness about this public health problem. This calls for the development of novel prevention and intervention strategies that are based on new approaches, including mindful eating. In this context, we aimed through this study to explore the factor structure, composite reliability, measurement invariance across sex, convergent and divergent validity of an Arabic translation of the Mindful Eating Behaviour Scale (MEBS). Methods: A cross-sectional study carried out between September and November 2022, and enrolled 359 participants, all aged above 18 years old and recruited from all Lebanon governorates. The questionnaire used included socio-demographic questions, and the following scales: The Mindful Eating Behavior Scale (MEBS), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), Intuitive Eating Scale-2, and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-8). Results: McDonald’s ω values ranged from.82 to.95 or the four mindful eating domains, indicating the excellent internal consistency reliability of the scale. Our study also showed that fit indices from the confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the original four-factor structure model of the MEBS. Furthermore, our analyses suggested that configural, metric, and scalar invariance was supported across sex. Our results found no sex difference in all MEBS subscales scores. Finally, we found positive correlations between Focused eating, Hunger and satiety cues on one hand, and intuitive eating on the other hand. Moreover, greater Hunger and satiety cues scores were correlated with higher self-esteem and lower body mass index. Conclusion: Our findings support the psychometric reliability and validity of the Arabic MEBS. We suggest, accordingly, that the scale will be of high clinical and research utility, and will help in the development of information-based interventions focused on mindful eating that are aimed to combat eating disorders and obesity in the Arab world. © 2023, The Author(s).},

For speech and language therapists (SLTs), understanding the features of these environments can enhance the quality of services. In New Zealand (NZ), the language learning environments for children in Arabic-speaking families are largely unresearched. Participants from 85 Arabic-speaking families living in NZ completed an online survey (with each participant representing one family). The survey collected information about some of the factors which are known to affect children’s bilingual language development. Analysis focused on education levels, parents’ language proficiencies, years in NZ, and language exposure. The Arabic-speaking population in this survey provided a high proficiency Arabic language-learning environment for their children. They had higher than average education levels and reported greater proficiency in Arabic than English. English proficiency in the parents was associated with education levels and length of time in NZ. Exposure to Arabic was predominantly within the home context. The consistent use of Arabic at home combined with a lack of formal teaching of Arabic literacy suggests that these children will be able to speak Arabic but may exhibit limited ability to read and write in Arabic. This information on a sample of Arabic families in NZ may be useful for service and educational planning purposes. SLTs are advised to investigate the individual linguistic environments of children growing up bilingual in Arabic and English in NZ as part of their practice. © 2023 The Author(s).

Online shopping has become an increasingly common option for people to purchase and fulfill their consumption needs. It can effectively boost consumer happiness by conducting sentiment analysis of many user evaluations on e-commerce platforms. This research proposes a new sentiment analysis model built on stacking hybrid deep learning models. In this research, we proposed a stacking technique that predicts accurately Arabic emotion by combining the prediction power of hybrid deep learning models such as RNN-BiLSTM, BiLSTM-RNN, RNN-BiGRU, BiGRU-RNN, BiGRU-BiLSTM, and BiGRU-BiLSTM with MLP word embedding. The suggested model's effectiveness is evaluated using multiple open access datasets: AHS(sub), AHS(main), AR-twitter, LARGE, OCA, OCLAR, OD, and merged datasets with 104808 items. The experiments showed that the proposed model is appropriate for assessing the feelings in texts written in the Arabic language. The first stage of the proposed strategy consists of the feature extraction employing the Arabert algorithm. Next, We create and train five hybrid deep-learning models. The subsequent step is to concatenate the outputs of the fundamental classifiers with Multilayer Perceptron. Compared to conventional and hybrid deep learning approaches, our approach achieved an accuracy improvement of 0.9668. © (2023), (International Association of Engineers). All Rights Reserved.},

The study used a cross-sectional design and surveyed a sample of Arabic language learners. Results of the study suggest that there is a moderate to low positive correlation between burnout, career readiness, and depressive symptoms, with burnout having a stronger correlation with career readiness and depressive symptoms than career readiness does with depressive symptoms. Additionally, the results suggest that burnout is a significant predictor of career readiness. However, the relationship between burnout and career readiness, through depression, is weak. These findings provide valuable insights into the relationship between burnout, career readiness, and depressive symptoms among Arabic language learners in Indonesia, but it is important to consider the limitations of the study, such as the small sample size, when interpreting the results.

Language academies are established in order to express national identity, constitute a main component in its culture and serve as a factor contributing to modernisation. The study reveals that the work of the Arabic academies is mainly instrumental, focusing on research and the structural aspects of the language, rather than primarily national, as is the case with more established academies. That means the Arabic Academies are professional bodies that deal with the Arabic language. While this is, of course, an important role, it should not be the principal function of the language academies. In contrast, the HLA deals with the structural aspects of the language, corpus planning, and also status planning, as the defender of the Hebrew language, and making the revitalisation of the language possible, combining both professional and national aspects from its inception. © Journal of Holy Land and Palestine Studies.},

	abstract = {With the increasing amount of digital data generated by Arabic speakers, the need for effective and efficient document classification techniques is more important than ever. In recent years, both quantum computing and machine learning have shown great promise in the field of document classification. However, there is a lack of research investigating the performance of these techniques on the Arabic language. This paper presents a comparative study of quantum computing and machine learning for two datasets of Arabic language document classification. In the first dataset of 213,465 Arabic tweets, both classic machine learning (ML) and quantum computing approaches achieve high accuracy in sentiment analysis, with quantum computing slightly outperforming classic ML. Quantum computing completes the task in approximately 59 min, slightly faster than classic ML, which takes around 1 h. The precision, recall, and F1 score metrics indicate the effectiveness of both approaches in predicting sentiment in Arabic tweets. Classic ML achieves precision, recall, and F1 score values of 0.8215, 0.8175, and 0.8121, respectively, while quantum computing achieves values of 0.8239, 0.8199, and 0.8147, respectively. In the second dataset of 44,000 tweets, both classic ML (using the Random Forest algorithm) and quantum computing demonstrate significantly reduced processing times compared to the first dataset, with no substantial difference between them. Classic ML completes the analysis in approximately 2 min, while quantum computing takes approximately 1 min and 53 s. The accuracy of classic ML is higher at 0.9241 compared to 0.9205 for quantum computing. However, both approaches achieve high precision, recall, and F1 scores, indicating their effectiveness in accurately predicting sentiment in the dataset. Classic ML achieves precision, recall, and F1 score values of 0.9286, 0.9241, and 0.9249, respectively, while quantum computing achieves values of 0.92456, 0.9205, and 0.9214, respectively. The analysis of the metrics indicates that quantum computing approaches are effective in identifying positive instances and capturing relevant sentiment information in large datasets. On the other hand, traditional machine learning techniques exhibit faster processing times when dealing with smaller dataset sizes. This study provides valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of quantum computing and machine learning for Arabic document classification, emphasizing the potential of quantum computing in achieving high accuracy, particularly in scenarios where traditional machine learning techniques may encounter difficulties. These findings contribute to the development of more accurate and efficient document classification systems for Arabic data. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: In Western countries, several patient-reported outcomes (PROs) measures have been developed and validated for knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients. While few PROs have been adopted for these patients in Saudi Arabia, which do not reflect all aspects of the Saudi socio-cultural context. Given this shortcoming, this study aimed to develop a new PRO measure in Arabic that covers all concepts related to health, function, and participation encompassing environmental and personal factors. Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 73 males and females aged ≥55 diagnosed with radiographic knee OA recruited from the orthopedic and physiotherapy departments of five hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between September 2016 and March 2017. Physicians confirmed knee OA according to the American College of Rheumatology standards. We examined the psychometric properties of the new Arabic PRO measure. Results: The internal consistency and test-retest (a one-week interval) reliabilities were found acceptable and excellent with Cronbach’s alpha and the intra-class correlation coefficient, ranging from 0.69 to 0.85 and 0.88 to 0.91, respectively. The construct validity was found fair with the correlation between the subscales Body Function and Physical Function (rs =0.63), Activity & Participation and Physical Function (rs =0.72), and Body Function and Bodily Pain (rs =0.58). We found a weak to fair correlation between the new Arabic PRO measure’s subscales and the SF-36 physical composite scale (PCS: rs =0.34–0.69) compared to the mental-composite scale (MCS: rs =0.16–0.55). Conclusion: The 33-item new Arabic PRO measure is a well-accepted, reliable, and valid tool for use in knee OA patients in the Saudi cultural context. © 2023 Alotaibi et al.},

	abstract = {Background. The Functional Rating Index (FRI) is a self-report scale widely used to determine the level of disability in low back pain (LBP) populations. Objectives. This study was aimed at conducting the cross-cultural adaptation of the FRI-Arabic version (FRI-Ar) and testing the clinometric properties of FRI-Ar. Methods. The cross-cultural adaptation process was used to develop the FRI-Ar. This study included acute and subacute LBP patients. Each patient was asked to complete the questionnaires at three time points: baseline, 24-hour follow-up, and two-week follow-up. The questionnaires used were FRI-Ar, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), Global Perceived Effect Scale (GPE), and Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS). Statistical analysis was carried out to measure the instrument's reliability, validity, and responsiveness. Results. The FRI was cross-culturally adapted to the Arabic language, and the adapted version was validated. Two hundred patients completed the questionnaires at the baseline; however, 120 patients completed the questionnaires at 24-hour and two-week follow-up. Cronbach's alpha, interclass correlation coefficient (ICC2,1), standard error of measurement (SEM), and minimal detectable change (MDC95%) for the FRI-Ar were observed as 0.85, 0.85, 1.17 (2.9%), and 3.24, respectively. The FRI-Ar showed a moderate positive correlation only with the RMDQ, ODI, and NPRS (p<0.05). Also, it showed the responsiveness with a small effect size (ES=0.29) and standardized response mean (SRM=0.44). Conclusion. The FRI-Ar was developed, and it showed good reliability and validity. However, it revealed the responsiveness with the small change. It can evaluate both pain and functional limitations in acute and subacute LBP patients. Before using it in the Arabic population with acute and subacute LBP, it is recommended to conduct further research to test internal and external responsiveness using an external criterion with a more extended follow-up period and suitable interventions.  © 2022 Saad M.

	abstract = {This study examines gender rights in the Arabic language, revealing the extent to which Arabic has been unjust toward women's political and social rights through its phonetics, vocabulary, grammar, and syntax. The study aims to uncover instances where the Arabic language has been biased against women, taking a hostile stance, and it also exposes the methods employed to undermine women's rights. This is accomplished by understanding the concept of gender, its relationship with language, and subsequently exploring political rights related to work, freedom, and social rights, represented by the right to visibility and dignity, which have been eroded in Arabic linguistic practices. The study concludes that the structure of the Arabic language is steeped in gender bias, reinforcing male dominance and constraining women in distinct ways. This constraint is evident in political rights such as freedom and work, as well as social rights like justice and freedom of expression. Consequently, the study recommends updating and developing the Arabic language to enable women to assert their equality with men. It also suggests the introduction of binding legislation to empower women in both language and society. © 2023, Pakistan Society of Criminology. All rights reserved.},

We conduct experiments that finetune the three models for NLU tasks and evaluate them on a large internal dataset. Despite the morphological, orthographical, and grammatical differences between Arabic and the source languages, transfer learning performance gains from source languages and through machine translation are achieved on a real-world Arabic test dataset in both a zero-shot setting and in a setting when the models are further finetuned on labeled data from the target language. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

	abstract = {Recently many banks around the world are adopting chatbots to communicate with their customers. However, the success of banking chatbots relay on customer adoption of this new technology. Although chatbots use in the banking sector is expanding globally, the Arabic world is still behind in using the technology, and chatbot applications in the Arab world are still immature. One reason behind this lag is the complexity of the Arabic language. This study comes to bridge the gap in the literature regarding what technology aspects affect customer adoption of bank chatbots in the Arabic world, and which type of Arabic language is the most effective in communicating with Arabic language speakers. UTAUT2 was used to figure what factors afect customer adoption. The data for this study was collected from two separate groups, with a total of 429 participants. Results showed that there is a significant difference between the model testing Arabic Fusha and Dialect Fusha. Results showed that Effort expectancy influences adoption only when dialect Arabic is used. Performance expectancy was also found to have no effect on the adoption of bank chatbot in both groups. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Today, the structure of the Arabic press language has suffered from damages that need to be addressed. These problems are mainly due to insufficient attention to grammar rules. There are also some pronunciation and expression problems that cause non-standard language patterns to penetrate the press language. Therefore, it is necessary to recognize these patterns and replace them with standard language patterns. Since Arabic has different types of languages and dialects, it is the standard language that can maintain coherence and unity between them. Promoting and reinforcing standard language patterns is the main job of writers, editors, journalists, and anyone who uses language professionally. Obviously, what is said by these people is usually considered as a standard language and spreads to other educational centers and the media. Currently, the language of the Arabic press suffers from the shortcomings and damages that have affected the body of the language. The media should try to enrich the Arabic language capacities and take advantage of all its possibilities and provide the grounds for the growth and development of the press language, along with extensive social, cultural and political developments, a flood of foreign aggressive words, the increasing speed of innovations and the arrival of new achievements. © 2023, Tarbiat Modares University.

	abstract = {Nowadays, there is a huge reliance on digital communication. Due to the lack of security, attackers can steal or tamper with valuable and sensitive data like personal information, medical records, or financial data. Steganography refers to the art of hiding data inside other digital content, including text, image, video or audio content in an inconspicuous way. Good steganography algorithm obscures the fact that there is sensitive data hidden in the cover medium. Steganography is one of the effective ways of securing data. This paper proposes a new technique for hiding secret data in ordinary Arabic text. The proposed technique exploits the redundancies present in natural language structures. For example, one can exploit the commutative property of conjunctive words such as 'and' and 'or' to hide one bit. Furthermore, one can say 'The boy likes blue and yellow colors' or 'The boy likes yellow and blue colors'. Whether saying 'blue and yellow' or 'yellow and blue', the meaning remains the same. The desirable features in steganography are the high capacity and imperceptibility. The capacity is the amount of data bits that can be hidden in the cover medium. Imperceptibility is the inability of an eavesdropper to notice or figure out the hidden data. A study on random Arabic passages was conducted to measure the capacity. Moreover, an empirical study on the imperceptibility of the proposed technique was conducted as well. The results showed that the proposed technique can effectively conceal data within Arabic text.  © 2023 IEEE.},

Methods. A quantitative, cross-sectional and descriptive method was employed, with the main focus on the contribution of rapid automatized naming skills and phonological awareness to Arabic language reading fluency. A cross-sectional study was performed for all children in six prim art schools located in Makka. A convenience sampling method was used to recruit children. For children to be included in this study, there were some criteria: (a) to have no academic or developmental disabilities; (b) Both gender (males and females). Questionnaires were distributed to the children with the help of classroom teachers. All questions must be answered and responded to. A total of 360 participants aged 6–10 years took part in this study: 280 males (77.7%, age mean = 8.9, SD = 3.27), and 80 females (22.3%, age mean = 9.2, SD = 2.44). Results. The first main finding of the current research is that the correlations between RAN, PA and reading fluency were significant. In the final model, PA was directly and positively predictive of RAN (β = 0.664, p = 0.000) and RAN was directly and strongly related to RF (β = 0.623, p = 0.000). PA explained 52.3% of variance of RF. RAN explained 51.8% of variance of RF. PA and RAN together explained 69.9% of variance of RF. Conclusions. The findings of this study add to our knowledge of the contribution of PA and RAN to RF, as well as the complex intralingual relationship between PA and RAN. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {The parents’ attitude toward vaccinating children and adolescents against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains inconsistent and needs further elucidation. The high rates of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region require intensive research to understand the determinants of this phenomenon. This study aimed to validate a version of the Parent Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines (PACV) tool in Arabic, the most widely spoken language in the MENA. The study objectives included the investigation of Arab-speaking parents’ views regarding COVID-19 vaccination of their children. Parents living in Egypt with at least one child aged 5–18 years were eligible to participate in the study that was conducted through an online survey with 15 PACV items. The PACV tool was translated into Arabic using forward and backward translation. To assess the psychometric properties of the Arabic version of PACV, Pearson’s correlation coefficient and exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (EFA and CFA) were performed. A total of 223 parents participated in the study: 59.82% aged 30–39 years, 69.20% were females, 46.19% were university-educated, and 40.63% had one child. The overall Cronbach’s alpha for the Arabic version of PACV was 0.799. The EFA of the 15 items showed that three domains were most conceptually equivalent. All items had a positive significant correlation with the mean score of each subscale except for item 4 (r = 0.016, p = 0.811). Regression analyses results indicated that education, previous COVID-19 infection, vaccine status of parents, and PACV score were significantly associated with the intention of the parents to vaccinate their children against COVID-19. The CFA results showed that most of the factor loadings were statistically significant (p < 0.010) except for items 4 and 7. However, the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA = 0.080) and the standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR = 0.080) indicated that the model had a reasonable fit, and the three factors were good in reproducing each correlation. Our study results indicated the validity and reliability of the PACV instrument in Arabic language. Consequently, the PACV can be used to assess COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in a majority of MENA countries for better delineation of this highly prevalent phenomenon in the region. © 2022 by the authors.},

The researcher employed a descriptive-analytical method to achieve this aim, using Romy’s formula to determine students’ levels of involvement with the textbook. This determination was made based on the presentation of their material and activities after verifying the validity and reliability. A total of 381 pages from sections of the textbook were analyzed during the 2019/2020 academic year. The study focused on 30% (114) of the total number of pages. The total number of activities on the analyzed pages was calculated (78). The study results showed that the coefficient of student involvement with the presentation of the educational material was 0.73, which is an appropriate value and a degree of participation that is higher than the acceptable academic limit and motivates students to conduct research and surveys. Regarding activities, the degree of involvement (0.684) was more significant than the educationally permissible limit, thereby giving the students opportunities to interact and participate. In light of these results, several recommendations and suggestions were made. © 2023. NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.},

In spite of these efforts, no public benchmark of diverse nature currently exists for evaluating Arabic NLU. This makes it challenging to measure progress for both Arabic and multilingual language models. This challenge is compounded by the fact that any benchmark targeting Arabic needs to take into account the fact that Arabic is not a single language but rather a collection of languages and language varieties. In this work, we introduce a publicly available benchmark for Arabic language understanding evaluation dubbed ORCA. It is carefully constructed to cover diverse Arabic varieties and a wide range of challenging Arabic understanding tasks exploiting 60 different datasets (across seven NLU task clusters). To measure current progress in Arabic NLU, we use ORCA to offer a comprehensive comparison between 18 multilingual and Arabic language models. We also provide a public leaderboard with a unified single-number evaluation metric (ORCA score) to facilitate future research. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

	abstract = {Qualitative studies are a valuable approach to exploratory research. Frequently, researchers are required to collect data in languages other than English, which requires a translation process for the results to be communicated to a wider audience. However, language-embedded meaning can be lost in the translation process, and there is no consensus on the optimum timing of translation during the analysis process. Thus, the aim of this paper was to review how researchers conduct qualitative research with Arabic-speaking participants and the timing of data translation. Three databases were searched (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for the period January 2010 to January 2020. Studies were excluded if the data collection was not in Arabic or the study was not qualitative or healthcare related. Thirty-one studies were included, 26 of which translated all transcripts into English and then analyzed the data in English. Five studies transcribed the data in Arabic, analyzed it in Arabic, and then translated the results to English or conducted a parallel analysis. The reason provided for translating the data into English before the analysis was to enable non-Arabic authors to access the data and assist with the analysis. The search results suggest that researchers prefer translating data before analyzing it and are aware of the possibility of losing meaning during the translation process, which might affect the results. A more thoughtful approach to the timing of translation should be undertaken to ensure the subtleties of language are not lost during the analysis of qualitative data. © 2022 The Author},

	abstract = {Social media is a common medium for expression of views, discussion, sharing of content, and promotion of products and ideas. These views are either polite or obscene. The growth of hate speech is one of the negative aspects of the medium and its emergence poses risk factors for society at various levels. Although there are rules and laws for these platforms, they cannot oversee and control all types of content. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop modern algorithms to automatically detect hateful content on social media. Arab society is not isolated from the world, and the usage of social media by its members has highlighted the importance of automated systems that help build an electronic society free of hate and aggression. This article aims to detect hate speech based on Arabic context over the Twitter platform by proposing different novel deep learning architectures in order to provide a thorough analytical study. Also, a comparative study is presented with a different well-known machine learning algorithm, as well as other state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature to be used as a beacon for interested researchers. These models have been applied to the Arabic tweets dataset, which included 15K tweets and 14 features. After training these models, the results obtained for the top two models included an improved bidirectional long short-term memory with an accuracy of 92.20% and a macro F1-score of 92% and a modified convolutional neural network with an accuracy of 92.10% and a macro F1-score of 91%. The results also showed the superiority of the performance of the deep learning models over other models in terms of accuracy.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

However, although social media users have benefitted significantly from the rise of various platforms in terms of interacting with others, e.g., expressing their opinions, finding products and services, and checking reviews, it has also raised critical problems, such as the spread of fake news. Spreading fake news not only affects individual citizens but also governments and countries. This situation necessitates the immediate integration of artificial intelligence methodologies to address and alleviate this issue effectively. Researchers in the field have leveraged different techniques to mitigate this problem. However, research in the Arabic language for fake news detection is still in its early stages compared with other languages, such as English. This review paper intends to provide a clear view of Arabic research in the field. In addition, the paper aims to provide other researchers working on solving Arabic fake news detection problems with a better understanding of the common features used in extraction, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms. Moreover, a list of publicly available datasets is provided to give an idea of their characteristics and facilitate researcher access. Furthermore, some of limitations and challenges related to Arabic fake news and rumor detection are discussed to encourage other researchers. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

CFA and SEM were used for quantitative data analysis, while thematic analysis was used for qualitative data analysis. The results of this study indicate that Arabic language proficiency significantly affects job performance and expatriate adaptation. It was also discovered that several personal and environmental factors contribute to the impact, including language barriers, the workplace environment, training, and support. This study is novel because it examines the effects of ALP on EA and JP in Saudi Arabia, in addition to personal and environmental factors; no prior study of this nature has been conducted in Saudi Arabia. The study is limited to Higher Education Institutions (HEIs); thus, its generalizability is restricted.

Adducing empirical data from Classical Arabic literature it can be demonstrated that the use of -ūt is mostly restricted to nouns of the pattern faʿal and that the resulting pattern faʿalūt is applied to many roots that are not attested in Aramaic. Hence, although it is not a common phenomenon, it is productive in Arabic, and probably the pattern faʿalūt existed in Arabic already before the spread of Arabic in early Islam which resulted in large scale contact with Aramaic. © 2022, Harrassowitz Verlag.

	abstract = {As ever larger language models grow more ubiquitous, it is crucial to consider their environmental impact. Characterised by extreme size and resource use, recent generations of models have been criticised for their voracious appetite for compute, and thus significant carbon footprint. Although reporting of carbon impact has grown more common in machine learning papers, this reporting is usually limited to compute resources used strictly for training. In this work, we propose a holistic assessment of the footprint of an extreme-scale language model, Noor. Noor is an ongoing project aiming to develop the largest multi-task Arabic language models-with up to 13B parameters-leveraging zero-shot generalisation to enable a wide range of downstream tasks via natural language instructions. We assess the total carbon bill of the entire project: starting with data collection and storage costs, including research and development budgets, pretraining costs, future serving estimates, and other exogenous costs necessary for this international cooperation. Notably, we find that inference costs and exogenous factors can have a significant impact on total budget. Finally, we discuss pathways to reduce the carbon footprint of extreme-scale models. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

	abstract = {Hyper vectors are holographic and randomly processed with independent and identically distributed tools. A hyper vector includes whole data merged as well as spread completely on its pieces as an encompassing portrayal. So, no spot is more dependable to store any snippet of data compared to others. Hyper vectors are joined with tasks likened to expansion, and changed the structure of numerical processing on vector regions. Hyper vectors are intended to analyze the closeness utilizing a separation metric over the vector region. These activities are nothing but hyper vectors in which it can be joined into intriguing processing conduct with novel highlights which make them vigorous and proficient. This paper focuses on a utilization of hyper dimensional processing for distinguishing the language of text tests for encoding sequential letters into hyper vectors. Perceiving the language of a given book is the initial phase in all sorts of language handling. Examples: text examination, arrangement, and interpretation. High dimension vector models are mainstream in Natural Language Processing and are utilized to catch word significance from word insights. In this research work, the first task is high dimensional computing classification, based on Arabic datasets which contain three datasets such as Arabiya, Khaleej and Akhbarona. High dimensional computing is applied to obtain the results from the previous dataset when it is applied to N-gram encoding. When utilizing SANAD single-label Arabic news articles datasets with 12 N-gram encoding, the accuracy of high computing is 0.9665%. The high dimensional computing with 6 N-gram encoding while utilizing RTA dataset, provides the accuracy of 0.6648%. ANT dataset with 12 N-gram encoding in high dimensional computing gives the accuracy 0.9248%.

	abstract = {Keywords and Keyphrases are very important to capture the semantics contained in texts. Their extraction is a topic of particular relevance to a great number of researchers. Keywords and Keyphrases are useful for many applications, like: Indexation, Information Retrieval, Classification, Recommendation, Contextual advertising, etc. Their extraction is a challenging problem. Many approaches have been proposed for Keywords/Keyphrases extraction for several languages, including the Arabic language. However, the question remains to: what is the most performing approach in this field of research?. In this paper, a comparison is performed between two different methods applied to Keyphrase extraction from Arabic Texts: namely, Naïve Bayes and an approach based on a graph model. The experiments and the results obtained attest that the Graph based approach is more performing than Naïve Bayes. For the first approach the F-score is close to 70%; while the second one obtains an F-score of less than 64%. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

For this purpose, a mixed methods research design was used to measure the extent to which the Palestinian Arabic language textbook meets the characteristics of a good textbook from the point of view of the teachers of Arabic language for the first grade of primary public schools. This method allows us to collect both quantitative (survey) and qualitative data (interview) data. According to the research results, the textbook still has a specific weakness and deficiency in the psycho-cognitive dimension despite the Palestinian Ministry of Education’s efforts to develop the curriculum. To improve textbooks through a national reform strategy, they must be freed from the constraints to which they are currently subject.

The findings reveal that santri generally recognize the importance of incorporating Arabic cultural elements into the language-learning process, as it aids in comprehending both the Arabic language and its cultural nuances. Some aspects of Arabic culture are perceived by santri as integral to Islamic teachings, influencing distinctive practices in their clothing and physical appearance. Despite these unique practices, the santri, living in a multicultural society, choose to integrate their daily lives with other communities, fostering harmony and embracing the multicultural diversity present in Indonesia.

Despite the advantages, genetic testing adds a layer of complexity in the management which is difficult to communicate with patients. The variability health literacy among patients may restrict their engagement in genetic procedures. Improving the language and presentation of genomic concepts can influence patients’ risk assessment and willingness to undergo testing. The study aimed to compare the knowledge and attitudes of cancer patients presenting to oncology clinics at The American University of Beirut Medical Center before and after watching a short educational video that clarifies the concepts of genetic mutations, genetic testing technique, and its purposes. Twenty-nine adult patients presenting to the oncology clinics and due to receive somatic or germline genetic testing filled a questionnaire which assesses their knowledge and attitudes before and after the educational video was played. The majority of patients had poor baseline knowledge before the intervention. After watching the video, the percentage of patients with poor knowledge decreased to a minimum of 3.4% and a maximum of 39% for each concept. Mean score for attitude questions also increased significantly. Effective patient education and counseling programs in the patients’ native language prior to genetic testing can increase knowledge, decrease hesitancy, and improve clinical decision making. A short educational video is an example of a simple intervention towards an inclusive approach in patient care all over the world. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to American Association for Cancer Education.},

	abstract = {In order for future-oriented thinking skills to examine both cognitive and language skills, there is a need to examine the skill levels of professionals across various fields of education. The present study investigated the degree to which intermediate schoolteachers possess future thinking skills in the light of Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) test dimensions in mathematics and Arabic language. Using a descriptive survey method, a questionnaire was given to 98 mathematics and Arabic language teachers in Al- Kharj, Saudi Arabia. It covered five dimensions of future thinking skills including planning, predicting, imagination, problem-solving, and evaluating the future. Results showed statistically significant skill levels across all dimensions for both groups. Additionally, significant differences existed between subjects in planning, predicting, imagining, and solving future problems, attributable to disciplinary specialization. However, there was no difference in evaluating the future perspective. The study concludes that developing future thinking skills through PISA dimensions is vital for quality education meeting contemporary needs. Recommendations include building specialized university programs, holding teacher training courses, and conducting an integrated study of future thinking across mathematics, Arabic language, and science to enable comprehensive understanding. In summary, intermediate schoolteachers were found to significantly possess future thinking capacities, but differences between math and Arabic teachers highlight the need to standardize competencies. © 2023 EJAL & the Authors.},

	abstract = {Background Sports performance is the result of an interaction of several variables, such as physical, technical, and psychological. The ability of athletes to use motivation, is an important predictor to achieve high performance in sport. SMS-II comprised 18 elements to measure six behavioral control factors. Aim This study aims to validate an Arabic version of the revised sports motivation scale-II (SMS-II) and measure the psychometric properties of factorial structure, internal reliability, construct validity, and sensitivity. Methods A total of 780 athletes from different disciplines (432 men, 348 women; mean age = 18.97 years) participated in this study. Athletes voluntarily responded to the version of SMS-II. Factorial validity was established by principal component analysis. Both exploratory (EFA; N = 390; males: 52.6%; females: 47.4%; [13–18] = 172; [19–30] = 218) and confirmatory (CFA; N = 390; males: 58.2%; females: 41.8%; [13–18] = 247; [19–30] = 143) analyses were examined. Results The 18 SMS-II items revealed perfect reliability (McDonald’s omega = 0.841, Cronbach’s α = 0.858, Gutmann’s λ6 = 0.952) and good temporal stability (ICC = 0.960, 95% CI = 0.915–0.980; r = 0.935, 95% CI = 0.889–0.963 at p < 0.001) over 4-week period. The CFA adjustment indices were perfect. Conclusion The results tended to clarify all indices as perfect adjustments to the theoretical model, ensuring the confirmation of factor structure and construction validity regarding the Tunisian sports workforce.

	abstract = {Loanwords are the words transferred from one language to another, which become essential part of the borrowing language. The loanwords have come from the source language to the recipient language because of many reasons. Detecting these loanwords is complicated task due to that there are no standard specifications for transferring words between languages and hence low accuracy. This work tries to enhance this accuracy of detecting loanwords between Turkish and Arabic language as a case study. In this paper, the proposed system contributes to find all possible loanwords using any set of characters either alphabetically or randomly arranged. Then, it processes the distortion in the pronunciation, and solves the problem of the missing letters in Turkish language relative to Arabic language. A graph mining technique was introduced, for identifying the Turkish loanwords from Arabic language, which is used for the first time for this purpose. Also, the problem of letters differences, in the two languages, is solved by using a reference language (English) to unify the style of writing. The proposed system was tested using 1256 words that manually annotated. The obtained results showed that the f-measure is 0.99 which is high value for such system. Also, all these contributions lead to decrease time and effort to identify the loanwords in efficient and accurate way. Moreover, researchers do not need to have knowledge in the recipient and the source languages. In addition, this method can be generalized to any two languages using the same steps followed in obtaining Turkish loanwords from Arabic. © 2022 University of Baghdad. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The complexity of the Arabic language in terms of morphology, orthography, and dialects renders it more difficult to conduct sentiment analysis for the Arabic language. This issue is made much more challenging by the practice of extracting text features from short communications to evaluate the tone of the communication. On the other hand, the technique for analyzing and assessing sentiment faces a great deal of difficulty. These issues might be hampered by the accurate interpretation of sentiments and identifying the appropriate polarity of sentiment. Sentiment analysis can recognize and extract subjective information from the text. This study intends to investigate the effectiveness of various Machine Learning (ML) techniques in understanding the sentiments conveyed by the Arabic language. In addition, the feature extraction from the dataset was carried out with the help of the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). As a consequence of this, the techniques of Adaboost classifier (AC), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Maximum Entropy (ME), Decision tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) are utilized in the process of sentiment analysis (SA). In conclusion, a model for ensemble-based sentiment analysis was developed. Compared to other machine learning classifiers cited earlier, we achieved better performance in terms of accuracy, precision, kappa, and ROC AUC-score for ensemble classifiers with 10-fold cross-validation. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: Dysgraphia is one of the learning disabilities that require a complex set motor actions. It affects writing skills in the form of poor handwriting, spelling problems, and difficulty in writing thoughts and ideas. Children with learning disabilities often show some soft neurological signs as graphesthesia. The aim of this work is to study graphesthesia as a predictive sign that could be associated with developmental dysgraphia. Results: Graphesthesia test showed significant difference when applied on dysgraphic children compared to children with normal leaning development. Conclusion: Graphesthesia is a soft neurological sign that showed to be affected in Arabic dysgraphic children and could be used as a quick predictive test for dysgraphia before applying the formal graded tests. © 2023, The Author(s).},

The situation of the Arabic language currently calls for exploring opportunities for language-in-education policies to inform basic and tertiary education. The paper contributes to the policy of Arabic language-in-education knowledge and understanding to support pedagogical practices. The implications of a recent research study analysing Arabic language initiatives in the UAE bring to the forefront new pathways for the development of Arabic language-in-education policy, pedagogical practices and curriculum planning in the UAE. This paper extends the discussion emerging from this previous research to address trends of language-in-education policies in Arab countries. Specifically, it highlights policy opportunities that have implications on teaching and learning practices of the Arabic language by its first-language speakers. This paper builds direct links between research and the practice of language policy and planning (LPP) in its broader sense and addresses the concept of Arabic language policy and planning in the context of Arab countries. © Liverpool University Press.},

It is challenging to develop a repliable recognition system (RS) for cursive languages such as Arabic. Variations in text size, fonts, word semantics, user Arabic region, etc. complicate these issues. Deep learning models can model big datasets and handle them. Good features can be selected and learned consecutively by both CNNs and RNNs. In numerous studies, both of these neural networks have proven to be superior than their counterparts. This is true for text recognition, voice recognition, and several NLP tasks (NLP), but they are not qualified to deal with the semantics of the text, so we decided to find the best DL technique for semantic Arabic language from a lot of research to be a survey to other searchers.

	abstract = {Background: The Postpartum-Specific Anxiety Scale (PSAS) is an international measure designed to evaluate anxiety experienced by mothers in the postpartum period from one day to six months; the scale was translated into Arabic and validated within Palestinian context to test postpartum anxiety among Palestinian women. Aims: The current study aimed to test the psychometric properties and the factorial structure within the Arabic language in a Palestinian context using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The sample of this study consisted of 475 Palestinian women recruited from health centers in the West Banks of Palestine using a convenience sample. 61% were of ages 20–30 years and 39% percent ages 31–40 years. Findings: The PSAS showed good validity and reliability indicators in assessing postpartum anxiety within Palestinian context. Results of CFA showed a stable construct of a four-factor structure in assessing postpartum anxiety among Palestinian mothers: (1) competence and attachment anxieties, (2) infant safety and welfare anxieties, (3) practical baby care anxieties and (4) psychosocial adjustment to motherhood, which is consisting with the original four-factor structure of the scale. Conclusions: The PSAS showed good validity indicators within Palestinian context. Therefore, it is recommended to conduct similar studies with clinical and non-clinical groups in the Palestinian society. The PSAS can be a useful measure to assess anxiety levels among women during the postpartum months; which will enable mental health providers to provide psychological interventions for mothers whose anxiety levels are high. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

The analysis of the content of the letters was carried out based on textological, paleographic and historical-comparative methods. As part of the study, letters from Mahdi Khan, his nephew Muhammad Bey and Abdulkarim, the qadi of Bolshie Atagi, are reviewed. The correspondence, reconstructed on the basis of the newly discovered five letters of its authors, shows the complexity and inconsistency of the views of the subjects of negotiations on their goals and objectives, as well as the ambiguous position of their active participant and mediator, qadi Abdulkarim. In addition, the letters included in this correspondence reflect the historical and political views of Mahdi Khan as an integral part of his political program to restore the former power of the Tarkovsky Shamkhalate. The paper provides commentaries and explanations for the names and titles found in the translated documents. In addition, a detailed analysis of the text of the letters is given with an explanation of the current socio-political situation in the region; of no less importance is the internal personal motives of certain figures, prompting them to make decisions. Thus, through the disclosure of these motivations, the personification of history takes place. The documents under study significantly clarify the details and mechanisms of interaction between Shamkhal Mahdi Khan and Beibulat Tayimiev and other influential figures in Chechnya. The paper also reveals the political context of the correspondence. As a result of the study, we acquire a more complete picture of the events of 1828-1829 in the North-Eastern Caucasus, anticipating a new development of the Caucasian War. © Y.M. Idrisov, I.I.

Results showed poor and insufficient inclusion of digital citizenship elements in the curricula of the three grades of middle school. They also showed variation among the three curricula in the inclusion of digital citizenship elements, but, in general, they all remained unsatisfactory. The study recommended more attention to include digital citizenship elements to meet students' interests and needs of the digital age. It also suggested conducting more studies in this concern for other curricula of the Arabic language in other stages. The major statistical and analytical approach observed in this study also unveils certain significant factors of digital citizenship that affect the results, factors like experience possessed by the teacher, age, and level of grades.

What punctuation marking does is that it defines sentence constituents and sentence boundaries, which is critical to such Natural Language Processing (NLP) downstream tasks as machine translation, automatic speech analysis and synthesis. Although there is a rising amount of accessible Arabic data on the Web, the majority of it either doesn’t contain any punctuation or it uses punctuation inappropriately. To the best of our knowledge, very few people in the Arabic NLP community have considered this issue. This paper aims to present a method for automatically punctuating Arabic text using a model based on a pre-trained transformer. The goal of the Arabic punctuation prediction is to identify and insert the appropriate punctuation marks in punctuation-stripped Arabic texts. Using a robust dataset with a large number of punctuated sentences, we trained and tested the system. The experimental results show that AraBERT v0.2 (Antoun et al. in Arabert: transformer-based model for Arabic language understanding, [1]) and AraELECTRA discriminator (Antoun et al. in AraELECTRA: pre-training text discriminators for Arabic language understanding, [2]) achieved the highest accuracies, 95.88% and 95.86% respectively, and overall F1-scores. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.},

We propose through this study to develop and validate a shortened version of the Eating Attitude Test (EAT) in the Arabic language among non-clinical Arabic-speaking Lebanese participants from the general population. Methods: 1175 participants enrolled in this cross-sectional study, based on an online survey. The Eating Attitude Test-26 items, Drunkorexia Motives and Behaviors Scales and Lebanese Anxiety Scale were used to answer our objectives. Results: Our results confirmed validity and reliability of the questionnaire. Exploratory Factor Analyses showed that all items converged over a one-factor solution, with an excellent Cronbach’s alpha (> 0.9). Confirmatory Factor Analyses found that the 7-item-version yielded excellent model fit. The instrument also revealed strong evidence of divergent validity, being highly correlated with measures of anxiety and drunkorexia motives and behaviors. Discussion: Findings provided evidence supporting that the Arabic seven-item one-factor structure of the scale (EAT-7) is valid, reliable, and can be used in clinical practice, preventive interventions and future eating disorders research in Arab settings. © 2022, The Author(s).},

Discovery of the origins of the ban on mentioning of the copulatory topic in Arab society made it possible to determine the range of invective means related to this topic, which the author divides into three groups: sexual intercourse, genitals and other private body parts, sexual deviations. An important feature of the approach used in this article is that lexical units are considered primarily as means of delivering invective meaning to the addressee, associated with concepts that directly encapsulate that meaning. Implementing this approach, the author identifies the main invective concepts presented in the Arabic linguistic culture, and also makes out a list of lexemes associated with each concept. In order to study this vocabulary in detail and determine its role in the modern Arabic language, the author analyzes its etymology and functioning in invective speech constructions that actually exist in various Arabic idioms. © 2022, Russian Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {In the past decade, we have observed a growing interest in using technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and chatbots to provide assistance to language learners, especially in second language learning. By using AI and natural language processing (NLP) and chatbots, we can create an intelligent self-learning environment that goes beyond multiple-choice questions and/or fill in the blank exercises. In addition, NLP allows for learning to be adaptive in that it offers more than an indication that an error has occurred. It also provides a description of the error, uses linguistic analysis to isolate the source of the error, and then suggests additional drills to achieve optimal individualized learning outcomes. In this paper, we present our approach for developing an Artificial Intelligence-based Arabic Language and Speech Tutor (AI-ALST) for teaching the Moroccan Arabic dialect. The AI-ALST system is an intelligent tutor that provides analysis and assessment of students learning the Moroccan dialect at University of Arizona (UA). The AI-ALST provides a self-learned environment to practice each lesson for pronunciation training. In this paper, we present our initial experimental evaluation of the AI-ALST that is based on MFCC (Mel frequency cepstrum coefficient) feature extraction, bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), attention mechanism, and a cost-based strategy for dealing with class-imbalance learning. We evaluated our tutor on the word pronunciation of lesson 1 of the Moroccan Arabic dialect class. The experimental results show that the AI-ALST can effectively and successfully detect pronunciation errors and evaluate its performance by using F_1 - score, accuracy, precision, and recall.  © 2022 IEEE.},

The Arabicization task has been concertedly shouldered by language academies in several Arab countries, such as Cairo, Iraq, and Jordan. In this study, Arab journalistic translators’ attitudes, familiarity, and employment of the proposed Arabicized terms in journalistic translation have been investigated. In this study, the adopted methodology follows the quantitative approach to collect and analyse the data of a small-scale survey among Arab journalists and translators in various media outlets in the Arab region. The respondents of the conducted survey included Arab journalists, journalistic translators, script editors, and interpreters at Arab press agencies in several Arab countries, including Jordan, Qatar, and Egypt. According to the survey findings, the proposed Arabicized terms by the Arabic Language Academy are not broadly circulated among Arab journalists and translators in the Arab press. Moreover, the results confirmed that Arab journalistic translators are not completely familiar with the academy’s Arabicized terminologies. Therefore, they do not use them in English-Arabic journalistic translation. To enhance the ALA’s terminology work of Arabicization, more effective endeavours should be directed towards circulating the academy’s Arabicized terminology among journalistic translators in the media sector in the Arab region through establishing cooperation and coordination channels between the academy and the Arab press agencies. © 2023, Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

Hence, preparation of text books of quality is important to ensure students receive the correct language information and are motivated in learning. Teacher teaching activities will also be facilitated with help from quality text books. This study aims at investigating errors in Arabic language text books for the fourth form used in the KSSM curriculum in Malaysia and recommending the appropriate corrections required. In conducting analysis, the error analysis approach recommended by al-Rājiḥī (1995) and Ṭu‘aimah (2004) were used. This combined approach introduced by these two scholars recommends four steps in language error analysis, namely, identifying, describing, interpreting, and implementing correction and treatment of errors. Findings of the study show that 70 language errors were detected in the unit studied. The errors were categorised as: 32 (46%) grammar errors, 16 (23%) spelling errors, 14 (20%) morphology errors, and eight (11%) lexical errors. This high number of errors demands that educators be more aware of language aspects in preparing text books, especially text books aimed at language learning. © 2023 ACADEMY PUBLICATION.},

The goal of this study is to get language back to its basic function of being a way to communicate. It can also be the basis for putting Wasathiyah Islam into practise in Indonesia. Methods: This study was carried out in accordance with the official guidelines for research ethics established by the Ministry of Higher Education Research in the Republic of Indonesia. Between June 11 and August 30, 2022, the research was done. The research was carried out with two approaches, namely quantitative first and followed by qualitative. After collecting and analysing data for a study, researchers submit their findings to reviewers appointed by Indonesia's Ministry of Research and Technology.

Therefore, researchers conducted interviews with 24. First, non-Muslims in Indonesia should study Arabic since language is a communication instrument. This includes religion, ethnicity, and race not limiting language acquisition. Second, teaching non-Muslims Arabic in Indonesia will help to implement Wasathiyah Islam there. Non-Indonesian Muslims who know Arabic will be more tolerant. Third, because Arabic is a communication tool, there is no big challenge for non-Muslims to learn Arabic. Conclusion: However, in terms of obstacles, of course, there are many big obstacles, namely the unsupportive Arabic learning. © 2023 Ritonga M et al.},

	abstract = {Background: All available scales to screen for child abuse may be challenging to administer due to their length. Indeed, a higher number of items is associated with more administration time and less motivation to engage in responding. We aimed through this study to examine the psychometric properties of a brief Arabic version of the Child Abuse Self Report Scale (CASRS-12) in terms of factorial structure, internal consistency, divergent validity, and correlations with measures of bullying victimization, eating attitudes and perceived social support. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional, web-based study among Community Lebanese adolescents; where two samples have been used (Sample 1: N = 852, aged 15.34 ± 1.18 years, 54.8% females; Sample 2: N = 404, aged 16.60 ± 1.51 years, 57.2% females). The construct validity was tested using both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Results: Results revealed that both EFA and CFA yielded a four-factor structure for the CASRS-12 that mirrors the original four factors captured by the original CASRS. The scale also showed a good internal consistency as evidenced through McDonald’s ω values ranging from 0.87 to 0.93 for the four subscales; and configural, metric, and scalar invariance across gender. Finally, we found that all CASRS-12 dimensions were significantly and positively correlated with more inappropriate eating attitudes and lower social support; and that psychological, physical, and sexual abuse correlated with higher bullying victimization Conclusion: In light of these findings, we potentially encourage clinicians and researchers to use this scale as a valid and reliable measure of child abuse among Arabic-speaking populations. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {A historical dictionary is a language dictionary which studies the evolution of the construction of words and their meanings through the chronological stages the language has undergone. However, despite its richness, Arabic does not yet have a historical dictionary which helps to monitor its semantic development throughout history and to understand its knowledge and scientific heritage properly. The creation of such a dictionary should pass through several stages and requires a lot of effort. The most important step consists in determining a particular word sense in a given context which basically identifies the relevant meaning of a word according to the historical period in which it appeared. In this work, we suggest a dictionary of meanings that allows us to capture the semantic evolution of each Arabic word by focusing on the date of its first appearance and the way their meanings have evolved. Our method aims to provide relevant information about the oldest date of use of a given word, as well as its meanings, users, and sources. So, one of our major contributions of this paper is to determine the meaning of Arabic words according to where they appeared based on precise documents and contexts. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {During the previous two decades, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) have been well tested, and the tools were validated in different languages across the globe. This systematic review aimed to identify the knee disease-specific outcome tools in Arabic and evaluate their methodological quality of psychometric properties of the most promising tools based on the COSMIN checklist and PRISMA guidelines. Articles published in English, from the inception of databases until the date of search (10 August 2022), were included. Articles without at least one psychometric property (reliability, validity, and responsiveness) evaluation, and articles other than in the English language, were excluded from the study. The key terms [“Arabic” AND “Knee” AND (“Questionnaire” OR “Scale”)] were used in three databases, i.e., PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science (WoS) in the advanced search strategy. Key terms were either in the title or abstract for PubMed. Key words were in the topic (TS) for WoS. COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments) risk of bias checklist was used to evaluate the methodological quality of psychometric properties of the Arabic knee-related outcome measures. A total of 99 articles were identified in PubMed, SCOPUS, and WoS. After passing inclusion and exclusion criteria, 20 articles describing 22 scales from five countries were included in this review. The instruments validated in the Arabic language are Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS), knee outcome survey- activities of daily living scale (KOS-ADLS), Oxford knee score (OKS), anterior knee pain scale, osteoarthritis of knee and hip health-related quality of life (OAKHQoL) scale, Lysholm knee score (LKS), international documentation committee subjective knee form (IKDC), intermittent and constant osteoarthritis pain (ICOAP) questionnaire, Kujala patellofemoral pain scoring system (PFPSS), anterior knee pain scale (AKPS) and osteoarthritis quality of life questionnaire (OAQoL),. All were found to have good test-retest reliability (Intra Correlation Coefficient), internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha), and construct validity (Visual Analog Scale, Short Form-12, RAND-36, etc.). Of 20 instruments available to assess self-reported knee symptoms and function, 12 were validated in the Saudi Arabian population. Among them, KOS-ADLS is the best PROM to be used in various knee conditions, followed by KOOS and WOMAC. The assessed methodological quality of evidence says that the knee Arabic PROMs are reliable instruments to evaluate knee symptoms/function. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The digital game-based learning has the potential to enable new forms of learning concept which could enhance student’s communication. Therefore, this study aims to determine the impact of digital game-based learning on students’ communication performance. Participants were 611 non-Arabic students enrolled in an Arabic language course. This study uses a quasi-experimental design. The students were chosen through a random sampling technique to be part of the control group and treatment group. Pre-test and post-test were used to assess the students’ performance before and after the digital game-based learning intervention. The intervention took place over a period of four weeks in which students in the treatment group used educational digital games during Arabic language class. On the other hand, students in the control group underwent the traditional Arabic language instruction. At the end of the intervention, several students were selected through purposive sampling technique to participate in a semi-structured interview. The result found that students in the treatment group were significantly outperformed in Arabic communication knowledge compared to the control group and the digital game-based learning affected many aspects of their communication performance. In addition to this, the students demonstrate a favorable acceptance of practising Arabic communication through educational digital games, which helps them to grow their self-confidence, polish their critical thinking, and improve their learning environment. © 2023, Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

Although a growing body of research on gender representation in textbooks has been undertaken, there is a paucity of research on Arabic textbooks. This study aims to examine gender representation in Arabic textbooks for Islamic school students approved by the Ministry of Religion of Indonesia to fill the research gap. This research employed a case study design focusing on three textbooks. The researchers utilized thematic analysis anchored in Rifkin’s theory. The findings show that (1) gender representation in Arabic textbooks, verbally and visually, is dominated by men, (2) gender representation is visualized from six themes showing male dominance except for the theme “traveling,” which is dominated by women, and (3) the pedagogical actions that need to be taken to overcome these problems are (a) Arabic language teachers need to develop materials when using government-endorsed Arabic textbooks and (b) the Ministry of Religious Affairs should promote gender equality through recommended textbooks.

This study was conducted to investigate the psychometric properties and the factorial structure of the SNA scale in Palestinian society within the Arabic language for students aged 16–20 (N = 727) of both genders. The results of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) yielded four dimensions rather than the original six dimensions of the SNA scale; (1) Salience and tolerance, (2) Mood modification, (3) Withdrawal and conflict, (4) Relapse. The scale showed high validity and reliability in the Palestinian context and can be used to assess the addictive behavior among Palestinian youth. Study findings showed that 45.8% of the studied sample indicated a considerable addiction level for social media addiction within the uniquely Palestinian context. Further research is required to investigate preventive counter-addiction assessment in sustainable and larger-scale research to limit the long-term consequences of growing digital addiction phenomena. © 2022 The Authors},

Importantly, the Arabic language greatly contributes to legal istinbāt among Acehnese scholars, the more a cleric understands in the Arabic language, the easier it is to practice law, and it is important for scholars to master the Arabic language and its literature, such as balaghah, ma‘āni, badi‘, bayān, majāz, nahwu and sharf because to understand the Arabic language is the inseparable and correlated understanding between sciences which is an integral unit, so that if a scholar performs Islamic law istinbāt but does not understand the Arabic language sciences, the legal fatwa he issued will be doubted. © 2022 Universitas Islam Negeri Ar-Raniry},

Aim of the work: The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of a language sample analysis as an easy applicable screening tool for narrative ability in kindergarten Egyptian bilingual children in order to reach a better understanding of their language profile. Subjects and methods: 150 bilingual Egyptian preschool male and female children exposed to Arabic and English languages were included and divided into two groups according to their age. All were subjected to the BEA-LSA narration assessment including macrostructure, microstructure items, and conversation assessment including verbal and nonverbal items. Results: The results revealed that bilingual children showed better performance in English than Arabic in most of the narration and conversation tasks. However, there was equal development between both age groups in English language regarding temporality, connectives, and reference clarity. The older age group showed higher code switching than younger age group and code switching occurred more from Arabic to English language. Both age groups bilingual children showed better frequency of words and mean length of utterance in narration. While in conversation, both age groups showed better type token ratio. Language sample analysis showed good test–retest reliability. Conclusion: Language sample analysis could identify the characteristic profile of bilingual kindergarten Egyptian children and was a reliable method to analyze both narration and conversation skills of bilingual children. © 2024, The Author(s).},

In this work we proposed a Semantic-Bert model for Arabic Question/Answer (Q/A) applications that incorporates explicit contextual semantics from pretrained semantic role labeling. It also introduces an enhanced language representation model, which is called Semantics aware BERT. The model is utilized bidirectional Long short-term memory LSTM (Bi-LSTM) to improve the correction in retrieving the answer when it selects the correct paragraph. The model is trained for 200 epoch and the results show that the proposed model achieves 0.75% and 80% in sensitivity. In addition, it achieves 61.5% and 90.4% in the sentence match. The selection of answering for most questions is highly accurate that most answers near from what need. Based on these results, it can be indicated that the proposed model is able to retrieve the answer correctly as it chooses the correct paragraph. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Abnormal eye gaze is a hallmark characteristic of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The primary aim of the present research was to develop an Arabic version of an objective measure of ASD, the “autism index” (AI), based on eye gaze tracking to social and nonsocial stimuli validated initially in the United States. The initial phase of this study included the translation of English language eye-tracking stimuli into stimuli appropriate for an Arabic-speaking culture. During the second phase, we tested it on a total of 144 children with ASD, and 96 controls. The AI had excellent internal consistency and test–retest reliability. Moreover, the AI showed good differentiation of ASD from control cases (AUC = 0.730, SE = 0.035). The AI was significantly positively correlated with SCQ total raw scores (r = 0.46, p < 0.001). ADOS-2 scores were only available in the ASD group and did not show a significant relationship with AI scores (r = 0.10, p = 0.348), likely due to the restricted range. The AI, when implemented using Arabic-translated stimuli in a Qatari sample, showed good diagnostic differentiation and a strong correlation with parent-reported ASD symptoms. Thus, the AI appears to have cross-cultural validity and may be useful as a diagnostic aide to inform clinical judgment and track ASD symptom levels as part of the evaluation process. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Background: The Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI) is a multidimensional measure developed to assess narcissistic grandiosity and narcissistic vulnerability. We aimed to validate the Arabic version of the original Pathological Narcissistic Inventory (PNI) and its brief form (B-PNI) in a community sample of Lebanese adults. Methods: The English language PNI items were translated into Arabic following a rigorous translation, back-translation, and linguistic evaluation. A total of 401 participants were administered the translated PNI, as well as previously validated Arabic versions of the Big Five Inventory-2, the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the Impulsivity-8 Scale. Results: Exploratory and confirmatory analyses supported the existence of seven first-order and two second-order factors of the PNI and B-PNI. Except for exploitativeness where females scored lower than males, no other significant differences by gender were observed for the remaining PNI subscale scores. Additionally, scores on all the subscales exhibited good reliability, while the associations with external measures supported the concurrent validity of the translated instrument. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that scores on the PNI and B-PNI are highly reliable with satisfactory concurrent and factorial validity, providing an assessment of broadly defined pathological narcissism among the Lebanese young adult population. The availability of the Arabic PNI and its brief form should facilitate improved understanding of pathological narcissism in Arabic cultures and the different factors that govern narcissistic personality pathology. © 2023, The Author(s).},

This paper adds nuance to such generalisations by examining debates over Arabic language pedagogy during the French protectorate in Morocco. Drawing on official correspondence and internal notes exchanged between the Direction de l’instruction publique (DIP) and local school administrators, this article shows that, far from disregarding Arabic as a school subject, French colonial administrators actively attempted to reform and modernise Arabic language pedagogy by drawing on European pedagogical methodologies and new trends in foreign language teaching. I argue that these overlooked pedagogical reforms radically, if unintentionally, reframed classical Arabic from a divinely privileged language offering unique access to knowledge about the world, to merely one language amongst others, a token of a type, in need of being taught according to the universal rules of language pedagogy. In doing so, I suggest that protectorate-era Arabic classes in DIP-run schools helped lay the foundation for postcolonial debates over Arabisation and the status of Arabic dialects. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Some translation methods overlap to the extent that they are an unnecessary proliferation of terms. The aim of this study therefore is twofold: Firstly, it examines four methods of translation (literal translation, overt translation, semantic translation, and direct translation). The study finds that these methods overlap to different degrees. While semantic and overt methods of translation apply similar features, literal translation has subtle differences from semantic and overt methods of translation. Direct Translation has more distinctive features than the other three methods. Secondly, the study examines the names for these methods in the Arabic language and shows how the Arabic terms overlap to a large extent, which is confusing to Arab practitioners. The study therefore suggests other names for the methods to minimize their overlap and increase their practicality. © 2023, An-Najah National University. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Many people nowadays seek the health information they need online, as an alternative to professional medical consultation. The current manuscript aims to evaluate the quality of the online information on oral contraceptive pills in Arabic websites. In this cross-sectional study, the term “oral contraceptive pills” in the Arabic language was fed to popular search engines. A list of 45 websites was evaluated in terms of accuracy/completeness, credibility and usability. The analyzed data demonstrated that most websites provide incomplete information about important issues, like efficacy, safety, instruction for administration, and when to use backup methods, which might re-sult in the delivery of misinformation and the consequent occurrence of unwanted pregnancy. In the majority of the websites, the articles were prepared by anonymous authors with unknown quali-fications and expertise, and without providing any citations, which questions the reliability and cor-rectness of the provided information. Moreover, most websites did not declare the source of their funding and the organization behind the websites, which opens the door for a possibility of a con-flict of interest and the exploitation of the websites for marketing purposes. On the other hand, most websites fairly fulfilled the usability criteria, as they were designed with a clear, consistent and legible layout of information, with easy navigation and information finding. In conclusion, the majority of the websites in the Arabic language provide information on oral contraceptive pills, which is inadequate, none reliable, none credible and seriously vulnerable to inaccuracy and con-flict of interest. © 2022, An-Najah National University.

From optimal training strategies, large scale data acquisition and continuously increasing NLP resources, the Arabic LLM landscape has improved in a very short span of time, despite being plagued by training data scarcity and limited evaluation resources compared to English. In line with contributing towards this ever-growing field, we introduce AlGhafa, a new multiple-choice evaluation benchmark for Arabic LLMs. For showcasing purposes, we train a new suite of models, including a 14 billion parameter model, the largest monolingual Arabic decoder-only model to date. We use a collection of publicly available datasets, as well as a newly introduced Hand Made dataset consisting of 8 billion tokens. Finally, we explore the quantitative and qualitative toxicity of several Arabic models, comparing our models to existing public Arabic LLMs. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

Understanding human speech production greatly benefits language acquisition. The Arabic language has novel sounds that are not found in other languages. Twelve Arabic letters have similar articulation and are very challenging to learn for native and non-native speakers. This study utilized dynamic MRI scanning to investigate these twelve Arabic letters' anatomy and dynamic motion. It is the first to discuss the details of acquiring dynamic MRI for recording Arabic phonetics. We developed a dynamic MRI protocol for this study, which effectively captured the motion of targeted sounds, despite being produced from different articulation points. The results showed that the investigated letters might sound similar. Yet, there is a vast difference between them, which was detected clearly by comparing the outline contouring of the MRI images. The results can be a reliable anatomical reference to teach the difference between the target sounds. Moreover, it helps us understand Arabic phonetics' intricacies and contributes to designing more practical, realistic, and engaging language learning tools for students of all ages.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Dixon's assertion regarding the idiosyncratic nature of natural languages initiates an investigation into the unique characteristics of the Arabic language. Contrary to Dixon's viewpoint, some scholars suggest the presence of regularity within Arabic, attributable to its extensive array of syntactic rules and formulations. Yet, the copious volume of terminal vocabulary in Arabic poses significant challenges to grammar development. While annotations have offered partial solutions, they bring forth additional difficulties due to the necessity of retrieving data from the annotated corpora. To mitigate these issues, an innovative study was executed that utilized an annotated taxonomy of syntactic roles, coupled with an examination of both fundamentalist and non-fundamentalist phrases. A codification method was applied to a knowledge base employing the Subsumption Hierarchical Attribute (SHA), enabling the integration of Arabic word classes based on their potential syntactic roles. The SHA acts as an annotation method for deriving a grammar class 02, where classes are coded as terminal vocabulary. Its primary objectives are twofold: to moderate the complexity of the parsing system and to automate the generation of over 1490 distinct possible sentence structures. The study culminated in the development of a novel context-free grammar (CFG) for Arabic, broadening the horizons of language processing techniques. © 2023 International Information and Engineering Technology Association.

However, they are rarely used as a teaching aid to improve the proficiency of non-native students except for those majoring in Arabic literature specialisation. This study examined how non-native Arabic students perceive the use of novels in Arabic language learning. It also explores strategies employed by students when using novels for Arabic language learning. This qualitative study involves interviews with ten students studying Arabic Prose Texts at the International Islamic University of Malaysia. The data, which were analysed thematically showed that students were positive about the use of Arabic novels in terms of vocabulary, language structure and skills. Apart from that, there were also negative responses in terms of low motivation, lack of interest and minimal exposure to Arabic novels. However, the variety of strategies used was able to raise students’ awareness of the importance and benefits of Arabic novels in Arabic language learning. Several suggestions are made for integrating literature and linguistics to make Arabic language learning more effective and student-centred through this new approach. © 2022, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak.

	abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to translate and analyze the psychometric properties of the third version of the Arabic Diabetes Attitude Scale. Methods: A methodological study of psychometric validation of the scale according to the guidelines of Vallerand cross-cultural validation was conducted. Type 1 and type 2 diabetics, aged 18 and over, without cognitive impairment or altered mental status were recruited on a convenience-sampling basis. An Arabic-language self-administrated developed questionnaire including diabetics’ demographic and clinical data and the experimental third version of the Diabetes Attitude Scale was used. All Vallerand cross-cultural validation steps were completed except for convergent validity and confirmatory analysis. Results: A sample of 333 diabetics was recruited. Reliability and validity of the experimental version of the scale were satisfactory. Correlations between test and retest dimensions were close to 1, and overall Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the experimental version was 0.769. The content validity index was 0.82 proving the accuracy of the concept measurements by the scale. Principal components analysis, by orthogonal Varimax rotation, produced nine factors. Correlation coefficients between the five dimensions of the theoretical model of the scale ranged from 0.002 to 0.367, confirming that each dimension measured a single content. Conclusion: The third version of the Arabic Diabetes Attitude Scale has been proven valid and reliable. It is ready for use in clinical practice. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS},

	abstract = {Innovative programs are introduced to educational institutions to enhance teaching and student learning. One of these innovative programs is the Lughati for Smart Education Initiative meant to strengthen students’ learning at the Kindergarten level in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates (UAE). The aim of this study is to determine the impact of the Lughati Smart Education initiative on the acquisition of Arabic language skills among kindergarteners and what are the strengths and areas that need improvement in the Lughati program from the point of view of the teachers who implemented the Smart Education program. A quantitative research approach was used to conduct the study, with a sample size of (100) children. Fifty of the students who underwent the Lughati Smart Education program were selected through purposeful sampling and they are considered as an experimental group and the other (50) who did not are considered as the control group. Also included in the study is a sample of one hundred teachers from the Emirate of Sharjah who have been involved in delivering Lughati Smart Education Program. The results of the study show that there are statistically significant differences in the variables related to reading skills, analysis, structure, concepts, and the achievement test in favour of the students who attended the Lughati program. However, there was no significant difference between the control and experimental groups in writing skills. As for teachers’ feedback on the Smart Education Program (Lughati Initiative), it was found that most teachers indicated that the program helped develop the student’s language proficiency, language skills through educational songs, reading skills, spelling, and handwriting. Based on the data, the study makes a number of recommendations, the most significant of which is to implement the initiative across all states and public schools in the country. In addition, it recommended that the program should be linked to the curricula devised by the Ministry of Education. School teachers should also attend training courses in smart education, and the program should be regularly updated. © 2023 NSP.},

	abstract = {Internet use resulted in people becoming more reliant on social media. Social media have become the main source of fake news or rumors. They spread uncertainty in each sector of the real world, whether in politics, sports, or celebrities’ lives—all are affected by the uncontrolled behavior of social media platforms. Intelligent methods used to control this fake news in various languages have already been much discussed and frequently proposed by researchers. However, Arabic grammar and language are a far more complex and crucial language to learn. Therefore, work on Arabic fake-news-based datasets and related studies is much needed to control the spread of fake news on social media and other Internet media. The current study uses a recently published dataset of Arabic fake news annotated by experts. Further, Arabic-language-based embeddings are given to machine learning (ML) classifiers, and the Arabic-language-based trained minibidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) is used to obtain the sentiments of Arabic grammar and feed a deep learning (DL) classifier. The holdout validation schemes are applied to both ML classifiers and mini-BERT-based deep neural classifiers. The results show a consistent improvement in the performance of mini-BERT-based classifiers, which outperformed ML classifiers, by increasing the training data. A comparison with previous Arabic fake news detection studies is shown where results of the current study show greater improvement. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Slangs are phrases that have strong roots in the culture of a given social and cultural stratum; translating them is challenging. Slang is a kind of daily socio-linguistic manifestation that emerges from a particular socio-cultural or socio-economic group's efforts to codify its members' ideology or mental projections. Slang refers to a language or set of words that are widely used but seldom defined. This study is an Arabic translation of slang used in 21st-century American songs. The research also examines how the slang was translated and the attributes that made them practical communication tools. Arabic speakers learning American English will benefit most from this concentration on slang and its context. The analysis is carried out through the thematic analysis method based on an apparent qualitative study. Twenty (20) slang terms borrowed from 21st-century American pop songs were adapted to be translated into Arabic. The study's data consists of slang expressions in the song lyrics of two American hip-hop/rap singers, Eminem and Wiz Khalifa. Marshal Mathers II by Eminem (2013) and Khalifa by Wiz Khalifa (2016) were picked as the only albums by each artist. To communicate with native Arabic speakers, the researcher modified the English-Arabic Translator used for superficial translation. Functional equivalents, social equivalents, modulations, substitution, and paraphrases are the main translation strategies adopted in translating the selected slang into formal Arabic. Based on the thematic evaluation, it was discovered that paraphrasing is the most effective strategy for translating American slang into Arabic. Consequently, the research shows that the meanings of slang terms are affected by context and situational variability. The conclusion is that slang plays a significant part in a conversation. To utilize it fully, learners must be familiar with their contexts and interpretations. © 2023 International Journal of Membrane Science and Technology. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In today's digital era, there are still many lecturers who conduct face-to-face meeting using the lecture strategy and using projectors and/or laptops as learning media. This educational model, although using multi-media, still has shortcomings because the interactions that occur during the educational process are limited on two-way interactions between lecturers and students. Learning tends to focus on the lecturer. In addition, learning faces obstacles when lecturers have to leave class because of other jobs outside the city or outside the island and even abroad. This traditional learning model also does not give students the opportunity to learn freely and independently. By considering this fact, the development of an ICT-based education system in a broader sense is urgently needed. It aims to overcome various problems and learning limitations. E-Learning system is an alternative solution to various problems. One of the e-Learning systems which based on computer technology is the use of website. The use of Website in the learning process provides opportunities for students to access learning material at any time and repeatedly so that the students can improve their mastery of learning material. Thus, the presence of lecturers is optional or even non-existent. This is because the parties who take on the role of lecturers are computers, electronic guides designed by content writers, e-Learning Designers, and computer programmers.

Applications in language generation for Arabic are still lagging in comparison to other NLP advances primarily due to the lack of advanced Arabic language generation models. In this paper, we develop the first advanced Arabic language generation model, AraGPT2, trained from scratch on a large Arabic corpus of internet text and news articles. Our largest model, ARAGPT2-MEGA, has 1.46 billion parameters, which makes it the largest Arabic language model available. The MEGA model was evaluated and showed success on different tasks including synthetic news generation, and zero-shot question answering. For text generation, our best model achieves a perplexity of 29.8 on held-out Wikipedia articles. A study conducted with human evaluators showed the significant success of AraGPT2-mega in generating news articles that are difficult to distinguish from articles written by humans. We thus develop and release an automatic discriminator model with a 98% percent accuracy in detecting model-generated text. The models are also publicly available1, hoping to encourage new research directions and applications for Arabic NLP. © WANLP 2021 - 6th Arabic Natural Language Processing Workshop},

We strongly believe that many NLU problems in Arabic are especially poised to reap the benefits of such models. To this end, we propose the Arabic Language Understanding Evaluation Benchmark (ALUE), based on 8 carefully selected and previously published tasks. For five of these, we provide new privately held evaluation datasets to ensure the fairness and validity of our benchmark. We also provide a diagnostic dataset to help researchers probe the inner workings of their models. Our initial experiments show that MTL models outperform their singly trained counterparts on most tasks. But in order to entice participation from the wider community, we stick to publishing singly trained baselines only. Nonetheless, our analysis reveals that there is plenty of room for improvement in Arabic NLU. We hope that ALUE will play a part in helping our community realize some of these improvements. Interested researchers are invited to submit their results to our online, and publicly accessible leaderboard. © WANLP 2021 - 6th Arabic Natural Language Processing Workshop},

	abstract = {The theory of Multiple Intelligences (MI) states that human intelligence is composed of different types of intelligences and that each individual possesses all of them but to a different degree. The main objective of this research was to examine how the Theory of Multiple Intelligences was addressed in a seventh-grade Arabic-language textbook at the intermediate-level in Jordan and determine Arabic-language teachers' level of knowledge of applying the Theory of Multiple Intelligences in textbooks. The study used the survey method and analytical descriptive approach via content analysis and coding MI indicators in the textbook to examine the representation of MI in the textbook examined. The sample was composed of all units of a seventh-grade Arabic-language textbook. A questionnaire was distributed to 130 Arabic-language teachers. The study includes eight of the Intelligences from Howard Gardner's Multiple Intelligences (MI) Theory. The analysis found that the intelligences represented in the texts, activities, and exercises of the Arabic-language textbook were mostly Verbal/Linguistic, Visual/Spatial and Interpersonal intelligences, with a combined percentage of 73%. The other 27% was shared between the other intelligence types: Intrapersonal, Naturalist, Logical/Mathematical, Bodily/Kinesthetic, and Musical intelligences. A moderated awareness on how to incorporate the theory of MI in Arabic-language textbooks was found among Arabic-language teachers, which means that teachers' understanding of the importance of including MI theory in the textbook needs reinforcement and improvement. The study suggests that further research on incorporating the Theory of MI in textbooks is needed. © 2021 The Authors},

In this study, we extend the findings of the system by analyzing the existing literature and validating its effectiveness in Arabic. In particular, we examined the effectiveness of the KDA system in Arabic for touchscreen-based digital devices using two KDA classes: fixed and free text. To this end, a KDA system was developed and applied to a selected device operating on the Android platform, and various classification methods were used to assess the similarity between log-in and enrolment sessions. The developed system was experimentally evaluated. The results showed that using Arabic KDA on touchscreen devices is possible and can enhance security. It attains a higher accuracy with average equal error rates of 0.0% and 0.08% by using the free text and fixed text classes, respectively, implying that free text is more secure than fixed text.  © 2021 Suliman A.

	abstract = {The author of this article presents some results of the author’s study of the Arabic-language epigraphy of old Lezgin mosques in the Akhty District of the Republic of Dagestan. The mountainous Akhty District inhabited by Lezgins is located in the far south of Dagestan and Russian Federation, near the Main Caucasian ridge. The inscriptions of mosques are an important part of the district’s rich epigraphic heritage. The method of continuous study of epigraphic monuments made it possible to identify many Arabic-language inscriptions in different settlements, and also in abandoned rural settlements in hard-to-reach mountainous areas. The author considers not all epigraphic monuments of mosques, but only some of them. Many of them are introduced into scientific circulation for the first time. In addition, a new updated interpretation of some inscriptions already known to science is proposed. The translation of the inscriptions is accompanied by scientific commentary. Chronologically, the inscriptions cover the period from the 11th–12th centuries to the end of the 18th century. The epigraphy of this chronological period is found on the walls of only some villages in the Akhty District. A portion of the inscriptions considered are dated. To determine the time of undated inscriptions, the method of dating by paleographic features of writing is applied. In terms of genre, the epigraphic monuments of mosques consist of building and benevolent inscriptions, excerpts from Quranic Verse. The discovery of Kufic inscriptions from the 11th–12th centuries on the walls of mosques indicate that the most ancient mosques in the villages of the Akhty District have a millennial history. The geography of Kufic inscriptions found indicates the early spread of Islam even in the most remote and hard-to reach places in southern Dagestan. The location of the inscriptions, which for a long time were considered not preserved, has been established. Among them is the oldest dated building inscription in Arabic on the territory of Russia — from 563 AH (1167/68). After the establishment of rural communities in the Samur district of Dagestan in the beginning of the 17th century, the construction or repair of mosques was carried out, mostly either by the communities or by the representatives of the local Muslim elite. © Санкт-Петербургский государственный университет, 2021},

	abstract = {The article studies the peculiarities of verbalizing the category of ambiguity on the material of English literary texts translated into Arabic. Seven texts of writers-postmodernist - J. Barnes, T. McCarthy, I. McEwan, D. Lodge, D. Mitchell, were chosen to be analyzed. The subject of the category of ambiguity research is both logic and philosophical, and linguistic. Lexemes denoting ambiguity are described in terms of their belonging to semantic (thematic) fields, including their contrastive and stylistic properties. There are involved proper lexical units denoting ambiguity, and contextual, occasional means, while their dictionary definitions do not reveal the semes of ambiguity. The study deals with the role and functions of nominative units reflecting ambiguity and uncertainty of the world contemporary literary discourse through translation into Arabic. The methodology is based on the functional interaction of lexis and grammar as one of the systemic linguistics principles. The study conclusions proceed from the provision on the Arabic language to demonstrate the system of various lexical means to express the ambiguity category, and their determinant to be implied in paradigmatic relations of language system, and syntagmatic relations between textual semantic units which both explain grammar structure of language and the nature of semantic correlations in its lexical subsystem. The authors draw a conclusion that both English and Arabic languages possess universal extralinguistic meaning of nominative ambiguity, while the semantic field nucleus fulfils the crucial function to select and assort proper means and units to realize the ambiguity category in texts. Differentiation of ambiguity nominations according to their application is not homogeneous due to lexical nominations making up the main means to realize ambiguity principle as both semantic and grammatical category. In course of studying the topic issue it seems adequate to study the topic of ambiguity conceptualization in languages of different structure and arrange the means to verbalize the ambiguity concept using the method of systemic comparison. © 2020, Association for the Advancement of Computing in Education.

	abstract = {The Google N-gram dataset contains millions of books in 22 different categories. Therefore, it is used widely as a language resource in natural language processing. The Arabic language has several resources, but most of them are small in size. As with any research, if training resources are large, then the validity of any research is higher. To build a new language resource manually by humans take years to accomplish, but using automatic methods can be done in a few days. Google N-gram dataset does not support the Arabic language yet. This will cause a challenge for researchers who use this dataset for extracting Arabic text. In this paper, an extraction method that can produce a lexicon and N-gram corpus from the English Google N-gram dataset is presented. The steps to build these recourses and to overcome Google N-gram dataset challenges are explained. The experiment results show the success of the proposed method in the automatic construction of the resources in a short time. This method will be useful to researchers in several research fields. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

On the other hand, current Arabic language representation approaches rely only on pretraining via masked language modeling. In this paper, we develop an Arabic language representation model, which we name ARAELECTRA. Our model is pretrained using the replaced token detection objective on large Arabic text corpora. We evaluate our model on multiple Arabic NLP tasks, including reading comprehension, sentiment analysis, and named-entity recognition and we show that ARAELECTRA outperforms current state-of-the-art Arabic language representation models, given the same pretraining data and with even a smaller model size. © WANLP 2021 - 6th Arabic Natural Language Processing Workshop},

First, the identification of the polarities (positive or negative) carried by the textual signals (e.g. comments) and non-textual ones (e.g. the reactions love and sad) for a given Facebook publication. Therefore, the polarity of each comment expressed on a given Facebook post, is estimated on the basis of a neural model of sentiment in Arabic language. Secondly, grouping signals according to their complementarity using selection algorithms. Third, the application of learning to rank algorithms to re-rank Facebook search results based on the selected groups of signals. Finally, experiments are carried out on 13500 Facebook posts, collected from 45 topics in Arabic language. Experiments reveal promising results. Copyright © CORIA 2019.All rights reserved.},

The Aim of this study is to investigate the effect of stemming on text similarity for Arabic language at sentence level. Several Arabic light and heavy stemmers as well as lemmatization algorithms are used in this study, with a total of 10 algorithms. Standard training and testing data sets are used from SemEval-2017 international workshop for Task 1, Track 1 Arabic (ar–ar). Different features are selected to study the effect of stemming on text similarity based on different similarity measures. Traditional machine learning algorithms are used such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Naïve Bayesian (NB). Compared to the original text, using the stemmed and lemmatized documents in experiments achieve enhanced Pearson correlation results. The best results attained when using Arabic light Stemmer (ARLSTem) and Farasa light stemmers, Farasa and Qalsadi Lemmatizers and Tashaphyne heavy stemmer. The best enhancement was about 7.34% in Pearson correlation. In general, stemming considerably improves the performance of sentence text similarly for Arabic language. However, some stemmers make results worse than those for original text; they are Khoja heavy stemmer and AlKhalil light stemmer. Copyright 2021 Alhawarat et al.},

	abstract = {Mastering Arabic language is essential for Muslims as the language serves as a fundamental tool to understand and implement Islamic values. It is due to the fact that sources of these Islamic values, as in alQur'an and Sunnah, are accessible primarily through Arabic language. Both formal and informal education undertakings to master the language are then encouraged in this community. In connection to the dissemination and internalization of child-friendly values, it is necessary that the teaching of Arabic be carried out within this framework. Using descriptive analysis as the method, this paper discusses how these values may work in an Islamic environment such as Darunajah Islamic Boarding School. Data collection is done through observation, in-depth interviews, library research, and triangulation. In this study, components of Arabic language teaching which include educators, students, material, learning processes and evaluation, are put in relation to child-friendly values. The study shows that formal teaching of Arabic in Darunnajah Islamic boarding school has been in line with the framework of child-friendly values, in the part of educators while dealing and manage their students, also in the part of the textbooks and teaching materials, their contents, oral drills and presentation, also in the part of learning and evaluation processes. Through this study, it is hoped that its implication, and also its recommendation, would be heeded so that child-friendly values may be integrated in the Arabic language teaching, its material and curriculum. © 2021, Universitas Negeri Makassar- Faculty of Languages and Literature.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study had three main purposes which were (a) to assess the adequacy and desirability of Arabic in health professional instruction by investigating students and teachers’ perspectives and attitudes, (b) to explore aspects of Arabic medical translations which are not meeting expectations, and lastly, (c) to examine whether the level of education is a predictor of attitude. Method: A questionnaire survey of medical and dental students at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels was carried out in 2019 at major universities in Damascus. Faculty members were also invited to participate. 346 respondents in total completed the questionnaires. Data were processed and analysed quantitatively and qualitatively. Attitude theory and Health belief model were employed to analyse and interpret the study findings. Results: Overall attitudes toward Arabic as a language of instruction were relatively negative. Students consistently exhibited a preference for English as the language of instruction. The one-way Welch's ANOVA test found a significant difference among the main subgroups (undergraduates, postgraduates, faculty). Findings also showed that students and teachers suffer from the inadequacy of Arabic medical translations in quality and quantity. Respondents were generally dissatisfied with the proficiency of medical translators, and the majority agreed that there is a shortage of up-to-date Arabic study materials. Discussion: Students’ implicitly considered Arabic as a threat to their career advancement. Inadequacy of teaching in Arabic was more evident among postgraduates. Syrian students’ desire to join the international medical community was one of the data implications. This study shed new light on the anomalous Syrian educational system as it provided a theortical framework which could further understanding of the interaction between different concepts that affect attitudes towards the language of instruction. In terms of directions for future research, qualitative field research is recommended to give an idiographic account of students and teachers’ subjective perception of the career threats posed by using Arabic as the medium of instruction in medical education. © 2020 King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences},

One of the basic parts of Arabic language is nahwu science, nahwu is the study of laying row in Arabic such as the kasra, dhamma and fatta. Jar letters is one of basic part in nahwu science. In this research, a detection system about Jar patterns will be developed with image processing approach. This system was built using Delphi XE with 7 sample of Jar letters where it will be used in the training process. The process of detecting Jar patterns is using a method that will find the distance value from training and testing process on the Al-Quran image. Training process stage begins with the bitmap extension file of the original image,then change the size to gray scale level and convolution edge detection so that it will produce a vector value for each Jar pattern. Testing process will be use the Pierce Similarity Algorithm to measure the distance value of the Jar pattern to be recognized. The percentage of system detection results obtained, the pierce similarity method is able to recognize a Jar pattern of 60-80%.  © 2020 IEEE.},

This language politics aimed to expand, defend, and celebrate the dominions of the Spanish Habsburgs over Arabic-speaking peoples in Iberia and North Africa. Using archival and print documents other than translations–especially those meant to promote the genealogies and collective memories of certain «translator dynasties» at the height of the seventeenth-century Spanish craze for genealogy–the Habsburg Arabic politics is shown to be much more pervasive than the (also pervasive) direct translation of Arabic documents. Arabic translators certainly contributed to Arabic politics in the Peninsula and in the Mediterranean, but they were not the only ones who ensured that the Monarchy’s reputation could rely on ongoing dominion over Arabic-speaking peoples and control of a prestigious Arabic past. © 2021 Universidad de Malaga.

The proposed TE model employs a genetic algorithm to derive an optimal similarity function and correlated entailment judgment threshold. The similarity function is formulated through a linear combination of text similarity measures and weights. Two text similarity measures are considered: cosine and the longest common substring. These text similarity measures are computed for each text pair. The weights represent the importance of the considered text similarity measures for generating an entailment judgment. The weights and correlated judgment thresholds are obtained by the genetic algorithm. Several experiments are conducted using the ArbTED dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. Comparative results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model. On average, the model achieved a 16% improvement in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, the average recall and precision values were 72.7% and 72.3%, respectively. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Nevertheless, e-learning is the future of education and it is crucial to offer a quality education, implementing emotional learning consciousness within the academic community. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted practically every country in the world. It created an extremely difficult global situation, and humanity found itself faced with an emergency state of working online and swiftly adapting its routine to a new reality. This was certainly the case in Spain when, in mid-March 2020, students were forced to study from home and teachers to teach at a distance. COVID-19-and its related restrictions arrived suddenly, and there was little to no time to acclimatise to the new way of studying. The objective of this study is to analyse the difficulties faced by students of Arabic as a foreign language, and to offer some recommendations to improve online teaching, applying the communicative framework, combined with the importance of introducing the psychology theories and emotional education which is key to obtaining positive results. First, the topic is introduced, then the way to teach and learn the Arabic language online is discussed. Afterwards, the methodology is defined, highlighting the relation between emotional education and the Communicative Approach. A hypothetical-deductive method is applied to this analysis. A questionnaire is responded to by students of the Arabic language in Spanish universities in order to get an insight into their difficulties when learning online. A qualitative study is carried out in order to analyse the problems faced by the students and offer some possible recommendations to improve the quality teaching of Arabic as a foreign language, based on the perceptions of the students, taking into account the social context experienced during the 2020-2021 academic year. © The Authors.},

	abstract = {Forensic-handwriting text analysis aims to link two similar texts, an input text and a stored handwritten text, from a specific suspect using distinctive features, such as motion, hand pressure, and character shape. There are various forensic handwriting text analysis systems that aim to analyze English handwritten text. However, scarcely any of them are proposed to analyze the Arabic handwritten texts. Hence, the examiners or inspectors are forced to manually analyze the handwritten text. This can be tedious and time-consuming for inspectors. This study proposes an offline multistage forensic handwriting identification system for the Arabic language based on Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) Fusion Technique to facilitate and reduce the time required for the inspectors or forensic examiners to find similarities in handwritten texts. The proposed system has four main processes: Normalization and preprocessing feature extraction using Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD), Sparse Random Projection (SRP), and feature fusion using SWT, recognition using Polynomial, Linear and Gaussian SVM classifiers. The accuracy of the proposed system is evaluated using the IFN/ENIT dataset of handwritten Arabic text using Polynomial, Linear, and Gaussian SVM classifiers. Moreover, the accuracy result of the proposed system is compared with the accuracy result produced by a state-of-the-art HATRS, which is based on Local Binary Pattern and SVM classifiers using several normalization sizes of Arabic text images. The experiential result shows the effectiveness of the proposed system compared to the HATRS model. The best classification accuracy of the proposed system (98.83%) is obtained using the Gaussian SVM classifier.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Arabic language learning, in Indonesia, is commonly addressed to those with Islamic Religion. However, there are several problems associated with learning this language in higher education institutions due to the mandated rule that students can learn it, irrespective of their religion. This research aims to reveal the institution's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats since the inclusion of the Arabic language in the higher educational institution's curriculum. A qualitative approach was conducted in this research equipped with the data sources of students, lecturers, and policy documents related to the curriculum establishment. The collected data were classified, presented, and interpreted before concluding. The result showed that the institution's strengths are the availability of lecturers with excellent Arabic language competences as well as a language and study center. In addition, by teaching Arabic, it creates more job opportunities for graduates. Meanwhile, the institution's weaknesses are lecturers' language incompetence in certain fields, which vary from different study programs or faculties. Furthermore, due to the location of the four different regencies, students from regencies are unable to utilize the provided facilities. In addition, the institution is faced with the possibility of losing prospective students that do not understand Arabic transcriptions. Copyright©2020 by authors, all rights reserved.},

In our case, we are interested in the aspect which presents the finest level of granularity. This level is named Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis. In fact, Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) requires two primordial steps: (i) extract entity aspects and (ii) determine the sentiments from all the aspects. Aspect extraction is an important step for the ABSA. It aims at detecting all the existing aspects in a sentence. The extraction of these aspects is complicated considering the presence of several challenges especially when the Aspect extraction is done in the Arabic language. In this paper, we propose a supervised system ADAL for aspects detection in the Arabic language. The obtained results indicate that our proposed method outperforms previous works to achieve 96% in terms of f-measure when applied to the same dataset provided by The International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2016 (SemEval-2016). © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

	abstract = {Despite its diversity, Arabic does not yet have a historical dictionary which helps to monitor its semantic development throughout history and to understand its knowledge and scientific heritage properly. There are only some incomplete attempts with various semantic problems. At first, an Arabic word can carry different types of meaning depending on the specific context. The relationship between Arabic words should be analysed and modeled in order to have a comprehensive dictionary. However, all dictionary versions that have been constructed till now are either unstructured or semi-structured. Also, they neither define nor present the relationship between different Arabic words. Hence, the use of a standardized and well-structured format is necessary to implement the Arabic historical dictionary. In this respect, it is worth noting that Semantic Web Technologies (SWT) including ontologies are a promising solution for building a unified standard model for the Arabic language. This paper examines the possibility of representing the Arabic historical dictionary using SWT in order to capture the evolution of Arabic words and their diverse meaning over centuries. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Hence, most of the techniques and methods adopted to measure the similarity between documents were reviewed to determine the most appropriate ones to measure the similarity in Arabic. However, the measurement of the percentage of similarity in documents in the Arabic language represents a major challenge faced by most of the researchers due to the nature of the Arabic language, such as complex morphological processes, ambiguity, and a general lack of resources. © 2020 Malaysian Journal of Medicine and Health Sciences.

	abstract = {The language acquisition is one of the most important criteria that contribute to the measurement of language proficiency for students and the objectives of teaching of Arabic in Malaysia are currently based on the Standard Arabic Curriculum, which focuses on mastery of the four language skills. However, the inability to master the four language skills is still very significant. This occurs due to the fact that students only learn Arabic to pass the exam and that learning strategies applied to the students are less interactive and effective which led to demotivate the student to continue the learning process. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study is to examine the impact of mobile learning towards motivation in learning Arabic language proficiency. The research focuses on analysing the participants' motivation regarding the education of Arabic language in particular, via mobile learning. The attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction (ARCS) model shaped the comprehension of the effect of education through mobile app towards the motivation of the respondents. A total of 273 participants in Malaysians Higher Institutions used mobile learning for Arabic language proficiency during teaching and learning process. After this, they will complete the motivation questionnaire. The results showed that attention, relevance, satisfaction, and confidence motivational factors had a significant impact on student's motivation to learn Arabic through mobile app. Hence, this study contributes to the significant empirical results on the effectiveness of the integration of ARCS model in mobile app for learning Arabic language.

	abstract = {In recent years, the utilization of natural language processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques in clinical decision support systems have shown their ability in improving and automating the diagnosis process, and reducing potential clinical errors. NLP in the Arabic language is more intricate due to several limitations, such as the lack of datasets and analytical resources compared to other languages like English. However, a clinical decision support system in the Arabic context is of significant importance. A fundamental process in NLP is extracting features from text-based data via text embedding. Word embedding is a representation of words in a numeric format that encodes the statistic, semantic, or context information. Building a neural word embedding model requires hundreds of thousands of data instances to find hidden patterns of relationships within sentences. Essentially, extracting relevant and informative features promotes the performance of the learning algorithms. The objective of this paper is to propose an Arabic neural-based word embedding model in the medical and healthcare context (called 'AltibbiVec'). Around 1.5 million medical consultations and questions written in different dialects are obtained from Altibbi telemedicine company and used to train the embedding model. Three different embedding models are developed and compared, which are Word2Vec, fastText, and GloVe. The trained models were evaluated by different criteria, including the word clustering and the similarity of words. Besides, performing a specialty-based question classification. The results show that Word2Vec and fastText capture sufficiently the semantics of text more than GloVe. Hence, they are recommended for healthcare NLP-based applications.  © 2013 IEEE.},

For this purpose, the study adopted a quasi-experimental approach that is based on designing the experimental and control groups. The experimental group consisted of 35 students and the control group consisted of 33 students from two different schools. The researchers, to this end, prepared three research materials and one tool. The materials represented in: Augmented reality technology, a list of creative thinking skills and a guide for the teacher in the steps of teaching according to augmented reality technology. The tool included a test of creative thinking skills. The researchers have verified the validity of materials and tool by presenting them to several of validators and verified the reliability of tool using the appropriate statistical treatments; the percentage of reliability of the test to the Pearson coefficient was 0.90. The results showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the mean scores of both experimental and control groups in the creative thinking skills test in favor of the experimental group (α ≤ 0.001). Therefore, the researchers recommended the need to pay attention to the improvement of creative thinking skills in the Arabic language through modern teaching techniques such as the current technology.

A review of the literature indicates that interactive whiteboards support the language learning, as well as to improve students’ achievement listening skills and motivation in school. The study sample consisted of 60 male students who were equally divided into two groups: the experimental and control groups. Interactive whiteboards strategy was used to determine the effect of teaching method of Arabic listening skills on students’ outcomes. The pretest and posttest scores of both groups were analyzed statistically using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) program. The finding of the study indicated significant differences between the groups at the α ≤ 0.05 level in favor of the experimental group. The results showed the following: (1) the use of the interactive white board strategy showed better improvement among the students than the use of the traditional method; (2) the effect size of using the interactive white smart boards was high, and(3) there were statistically significant differences between the mean posttest scores of the two groups in the Arabic listening skills in favor of the experimental group. Based on the findings of this study, the research indicates that (IWB) strategies can be used in teaching Arabic listening skills because of their positive effect on student achievement scores.

	abstract = {Twitter has had a prominent role during the Covid-19 pandemic in discussing public healthcare-related events, including vaccine efficacy. In this context, the sentiments of individuals about the vaccine have varied between supporters of vaccination programs, and opponents who advocate others not to vaccinate. Being able to identify anti-vaxxers through their tweets could enable public health organizations to make wise decisions to enhance vaccine acceptance, by allocating customized awareness campaigns to individuals to reduce anti-vaccination sentiments among different groups. This study aims to provide a smart classification model that can identify the sentiments of individuals in the Middle East region toward Covid-19 vaccinations through the Arabic tweets they publish on their own Twitter accounts, exploiting Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning-based models. Nine well-known Machine Learning algorithms and four Deep Learning algorithms were investigated with various feature extraction techniques (TF, TF-IDF, and Glove). The results show that the performance of the TF model outperforms other models in the Multinomial Naïve Bayes with an accuracy of 82.14%. On the other hand, the performance of the TF-IDF model outperforms other models in the Support Vector Machine with an accuracy of 81.81%. Finally, the Glove word embedding model outperforms other models in the LSTM with an accuracy of 81.67%.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Although the existence of common words between Persian and Arabic languages occasionally facilitates learning Arabic for Persian speakers, it also causes numerous problems, including linguistic interference, for language learners putting language skills into action. Overall, language similarities between Persian and Arabic can be classified into two types: structural and lexical. Lexical similarities may have three different major kinds: 1. similarities in the shape of writing and meaning occurring in nouns, verbs, and letters, with the highest frequencies in nouns; 2. similarities in the shape of writing and complete or partial contrast in meaning, which is mostly seen in nouns and occasionally in verbs; and 3. partial similarities in meaning and contrast in form which is typically observed in Arabic and Persian prepositions. In the current research, not taking structural similarities into consideration and employing a descriptive-analytical survey approach, the effect of common words between Persian and Arabic languages on the writing skill of undergraduate students of Arabic Language and Literature was studied. The statistical population of this research consists of 10 state universities, including Arak, Tehran, Bu-Ali Sina, Kharazmi, Al-Zahra, Guilan, Shahid Beheshti, Shiraz, Allameh Tabataba’i, and Ferdowsi universities. It also includes 199 undergraduate students passing Writing Skill 1 or 3 courses. Since the current study examined the common words between Arabic and Persian languages and the effects of the words on Arabic language learners’ writing from a contrastive perspective, it is considered a pioneer study in this field. The research questions are as follows: 1. How good are the students’ vocabulary skills regarding the common words between Arabic and Persian languages in Writing Skill 1 and 3 courses? 2. How does the time difference of offering writing skill courses affect students’ vocabulary banks? To answer the research questions, we used a self-constructed test including the common words between Arabic and Persian languages. The test was designed in four steps: 1. Collecting language learners’ highest frequency errors and including them in the test. 2. Test verification: After predicting language learners’ errors, the test was designed and 6 copies of the test were given to 6 language skills professors. Modifications were made on the test based on the experts’ comments and then the test reliability was confirmed. 3. Conducting the test: The Writing Skill 1 and 3 tests were given to students in Shahid Beheshti and Allameh Tabataba’i universities. After examining the language learners’ performance, the test was modified. The reliability coefficients were obtained for both tests. In the next step, the test was given to the students in all the above-mentioned universities. 4. Test analysis: to analyze the test, both quantitative and qualitative methods were employed. According to the quantitative method, the students’ correct answers were marked once (out of 100). The researchers used t-test to determine whether the means of the two universities’ marks in Writing Skill 1 and 3 courses are equal to each other. And to examine the effect of the time of offering the course on these errors, logistic regression analysis was employed. Logically speaking, the signifier with a stabilized signified in our minds causes problems when referring to a different signified. In other words, it is less problematic to relate two different concepts (signified) to two different words in two languages than to relate a common word between two languages to two different concepts and, simultaneously, be cautious enough not to get the different concepts in the two languages mixed up. A lack of awareness of the common words’ semantic and practical differences results in linguistic interference. Given the high frequency of Arabic words in Persian language, mostly with semantic, structural, and practical differences, the phenomenon of linguistic interference is typically expected in the process of learning Arabic language by Persian speakers. To perceive the differences and similarities of the common words between Arabic and Persian languages, a contrastive study was conducted. As for the next step, error analysis, which is the next stage in a contrastive study, was employed because a contrastive study predicts the errors by comparing two language levels and discovering the similarities and differences between two languages, while error analysis either confirms or rejects the predictions. Furthermore, the analysis of linguistic errors, including linguistic interference, provides the researcher with a picture of language learners’ progress and enables him to identify their learning dimensions and address the overlooked aspect of teaching process; by focusing on this aspect in the process of teaching and learning a language, the researcher can help fix the problem. The research results revealed the fact that after passing the writing skill courses, the students’ vocabulary banks were significantly expanded. Also, there is a direct relationship between learners’ language interferences and the semester during which they take the course but this relationship disappears, once they pass the first two writing skill courses and start taking Writing Skill 3. This shows language learners’ capability in using the vocabulary in Writing Skill 3 course. Further, the t-test results highlighted the significance of students’ progress in Writing Skill 3, compared to their abilities in Writing Skill 1 course, in all the above-mentioned universities except Tehran and Kharazmi universities. However, the classification of students’ marks in Writing Skill 1 and 3 courses indicated that this progress was inconsiderable because none of these universities got top marks. This finding showed that despite the students’ progress in vocabulary skills during Writing Skill 3 course, compared to Writing Skill 1, they still had problems determining the semantic differences between common words as well as using the vocabulary in Arabic language. The factors leading to this weakness include vocabulary interference and vocabulary deficit. The domination of grammar-based thinking in the minds of most of the students has made them assume that a correct sentence in Arabic language is the one which is grammatically and syntactically correct. It is likely that the difference in Arabic and Persian grammars, due to their belonging to different language families, causes more problems for Persian speakers trying to learn Arabic language. However, the attitude of Arabic language teaching departments in Iran may have been effective. In other words, in teaching Arabic, the focus is mostly on learning the grammar rather than communicating and conveying a message to any target language speakers. © 2020, Tarbiat Modares University.

	abstract = {Enabling empathetic behavior in Arabic dialogue agents is an important aspect of building human-like conversational models. While Arabic Natural Language Processing has seen significant advances in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) with language models such as AraBERT, Natural Language Generation (NLG) remains a challenge. The shortcomings of NLG encoder-decoder models are primarily due to the lack of Arabic datasets suitable to train NLG models such as conversational agents. To overcome this issue, we propose a transformer-based encoder-decoder initialized with AraBERT parameters. By initializing the weights of the encoder and decoder with AraBERT pre-trained weights, our model was able to leverage knowledge transfer and boost performance in response generation. To enable empathy in our conversational model, we train it using the ArabicEmpatheticDialogues dataset and achieve high performance in empathetic response generation. Specifically, our model achieved a low perplexity value of 17.0 and an increase in 5 BLEU points compared to the previous state-of-the-art model. Also, our proposed model was rated highly by 85 human evaluators, validating its high capability in exhibiting empathy while generating relevant and fluent responses in open-domain settings. © WANLP 2021 - 6th Arabic Natural Language Processing Workshop},

As a result, the detection of hate speech has been a vital area of research in the last decade. Nevertheless, the progress of development and incorporation of hate speech detectors in general and racism detectors in particular in the Arab region is considered to be relatively slow in comparison to English speaking countries. Therefore, this work aims to contribute to the detection of cyber-racism in the Arab region by considering the complicated nature of the Arabic language through tailored data acquisition and multi-staged pre-processing models. Furthermore, it takes into account the specificity of the application of racism detection in comparison to more broad sentiment analysis models that validly call for complicated architectures. Our proposed approach utilizes deep learning techniques due to their superiority given the availability of very large datasets.

Solr is an Information Retrieval System (IRS) that is widely known for its accurate results and high performance in English. However, Arabic stemmer that is currently used by Solr is called Light-10 which has some deficiencies. In this approach, we evaluated two light stemmers (Assem, Tashaphyne) and two root stemmers (Khoja, ISRI) and chose the two stemmers that the experiments show the best; in addition to Light-10 stemmer. The highest two stemmers are Assem and Khoja. So, we used these two stemmers and Light-10 to evaluate the search retrieval accuracy of Solr in Arabic, then evaluated them again with synonyms. The evaluation is based on using two metrics Precision and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). Assem stemmer has the highest accuracy which is 86%, Light-10 is 83% and Khoja is 81%. Finally, Assem stemmer has been used as the stemmer for Almufed search engine that we developed in this approach based on Solr for more than 6000 Arabic books from Alshamela Library. © 2020 IEEE.},

It is known that vowel quality varies depending on the place or the manner of articulation of a preceding or a succeeding consonant; the coarticulation process affects considerably the production of phonemes in sequence. The present study shows that the larynx vertical movement gesture for pharyngeal consonants in Moroccan Arabic overlaps as coarticulation on adjacent vowels. The obtained results give us an overview of the larynx activity during the production of the three short vowels /a, i, u/ in an environment where the larynx rises relative to the rest position. The consequences of change in the vertical dimension of the pharynx due to the larynx raising on vowel quality are also explored. The coarticulatory effects will be assessed through the frequency modifications of F1, F2, F3, F4 and the variation in the distance F2-F1. © ICNLSP 2021. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {A conversational agent (chatbot) is a software that can communicate with humans using natural language. Conversation modeling is an extremely important topic in natural language processing and artificial intelligence (AI). Indeed, since the birth of AI, creating a good chatbot remains one of the most difficult challenges in this field. Although chatbots can be used for a variety of tasks, they generally need to understand what users are saying and to provide appropriate answers to their questions. In this paper, we present midoBot: a deep learning Arabic chatbot based on the seq2seq model. midoBot is capable of conversing with humans on popular conversation topics through text. We built the model and tested it in the Tensorflow 2 deep learning framework using the most seq 2 seq Model architectures. We use a dataset of ~81,659 pairs of conversations created manually and without any handcrafted rules. Our algorithm was trained on a VM on google cloud (GPU TESLA K80 10 GO). The results obtained are significant, In most questions the chatbot was able to reproduce good answers. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Aims: Targeting the Aetiology of Nocturia to Guide Outcomes (TANGO) is a validated English language questionnaire to identify underlying factors leading to nocturia. We set out to provide a culturally correct Arabic version of the TANGO questionnaire in Saudi Arabia. Methods: The English version underwent forwarded and backward translation. The final version was administered to native Arabic speaking hospital employees and patients. Test-retest reliability and the clarity of questions were determined by Kappa and Cronbach's α statistics. Results: The translation: The median Likert score for translated questions was ≥4 with a Cronbach's α.865. Test-retest reliability: Thirty employees answered the questionnaire. The median, standard deviation (SD), and range were age 29.0 ± 11.0 years (20-55), and nocturia 1.0 ± 0.96 episodes per night (0-4). Three questions had identical constant answers and no Kappa values were computed. Based on prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted Kappa (PABAK) values, 10 questions had a “very good” agreement, eight questions had a “good” agreement, and one item had a “moderate” agreement. The range of PABAK was 0.53 to 1, P <.01. Clarity of questions: The employees had a median Likert score of 5.0 with a Cronbach's α.961. Thirty-two patients answered the questionnaire. The median, SD, and range were age 40.0 ± 15.4 years (17-79), and nocturia 1.0 ± 1.6 episodes per night (0-6). The median item score on the Likert scale was 5.0, with a Cronbach's α.909. A total of 29 (90.6%) patients stated that the questions were clear or needed no help to fill in the questionnaire. Conclusion: The Arabic language translation of TANGO questionnaire is a valid tool in the dialect of Saudi Arabia. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC},

	abstract = {The article is devoted to the issue of word-formation motivation, which does not lose its relevance and plays a role not only in disclosing formal-semantic relations between words of one language and has not only theoretical, but also applied significance. The authors consider word-formation motivation consistently in its varieties in a comparative way on the materials of so different languages as Russian and Arabic and approach the mechanism of achieving semantic equivalence of translation. To the greatest extent, word-formation activity today, due to objective reasons, affects some special branch (technical, medical, etc.) vocabulary, which is increasing from year to year in national dictionaries. This extensive material, selected by the authors, not only illustrates the current trends in word formation in modern languages, but also provides an answer to the question about the degree of equivalence of this subgroup of words in Russian and Arabic. The goal to compare word-formation motivation according to a number of criteria in different-structured languages made possible not only to obtain theoretical information about what features each of the languages has in word formation and what derivational potential it has, but also to reveal an algorithm for translating derived words from one language to another. For this, the authors complete a number of such particular tasks as highlighting significant elements in the neologisms of the Russian and Arabic languages, establishing standards for the formation of scientific and terminological vocabulary in Arabic, searching for tools (transformation operations, specific word-formation formants) that will contribute to the achievement of translation equivalence from Russian to Arabic, etc. Also the analysis of differences in the mechanisms of the formation of new vocabulary in the Russian and Arabic languages provided an opportunity to supplement the relatively young and rapidly developing private methodology of Russian-Arabic translation. © 2021, RUDN UNiversity.

To investigate this question, we apply mT5 on a language with a wide variety of dialects-Arabic. For evaluation, we introduce a novel benchmark for ARabic language GENeration (ARGEN), covering seven important tasks. For model comparison, we pre-train three powerful Arabic T5-style models and evaluate them on ARGEN. Although pre-trained with ~ 49% less data, our new models perform significantly better than mT5 on all ARGEN tasks (in 52 out of 59 test sets) and set several new SOTAs. Our models also establish new SOTA on the recently-proposed, large Arabic language understanding evaluation benchmark ARLUE (Abdul-Mageed et al., 2021). Our models are publicly available. We also link to individual ARGEN datasets through our public repository. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

The need for acceptance and the readiness of teachers to work independently in a digital environment is now especially great since students are familiar with electronic technology. Peculiarities of teaching the Arabic language require increased attention to learning writing and confident knowledge from teachers. Argumentative writing is important for teachers precisely in terms of its use to motivate students in e-learning and increase their engagement. Research paper points to the relationship between teachers’ writing skills and students’ advancement in writing when learning Arabic, especially as a foreign language. To achieve the purpose of the study, the descriptive method was applied. The sample of the study consisted of 120 teachers of UAE primary schools (40 male and 80 female), who were chosen randomly. The instrument of the study is a questionnaire divided into seven areas of argumentative writing. The study evaluates writing skills closely related to the effectiveness of presenting information to an online audience and in preparing e-learning programs. The results show that the argumentative writing skills in Arabic language teachers are moderate. There are statistically significant differences on the argumentative writing skills attributed to the gender variable in favor of the females. There are no statistically significant differences among the sample participants ascribed to qualification variable. Finally, there are statistically significant differences on argumentative writing skills ascribed to the experience variable, in favor of 10 years of experience or more.

The standardization sample on which the test was then applied was 400 normal Egyptian children in the age range from 2 to 4 years old 200 at 2–3 years old and 200 at 3–4 years old. Retesting was done on 30 children (15 in each group) to prove test-retest reliability, with an interval of 2 weeks. Validity of the test was done using, internal consistency validity, contrasted group validity, factorial validity, face validity, and judgment validity. In the contrasted group validity, a sample of 40 children with delayed language was used. Results: All validity tests used gave significant scores that proved the high validity of the newly revised test. Also, reliability tests were highly significant. Conclusion: The newly revised Arabic language test for 2–4 years old is a reliable and valid test to be used to evaluate language development and to detect language deficits among Egyptian children in the same age range. © The Author(s). 2021.},

	abstract = {Since 2010, other Arabic Language Education Departments have been founded to train Arabic language teachers at both state and foundation universities. As of 2020-2021, a total of eight universities are actively training Arabic language teachers. Although teaching is considered a fundamental duty of academics, making academic publications is as important as giving lectures in the context of contributing to the home country and the world literature. This study aims to provide a survey into the publications of the permanent academic staff of eight active Arabic Language Education Departments in Turkey in terms of several aspects such as quantity, type of publication, distribution by a person, or a relation between the academics BA major and their publications. The results of the study reveal that the academics working at Arabic Language Education Departments published mainly literature-related academic works even though they worked at education faculties. It was found that the publications in the field of education constituted only one-fifth of the total number of academic publications. Another result is that the number of publications on theology, which are not related to Arabic education, is almost equal to educational publications in number. © 2021 Cognizance Research Associates - Published by JLLS.},

Two Arabic keywords that mean “epilepsy” and “convulsion” were used on the search engine of each platform to extract related content. Two reviews were conducted for 300 randomly selected pages, accounts, and videos from a total of 795 related published ones on the targeted platforms. Results revealed that Arabic language content related to epilepsy on social media platforms has been available for about one decade. Various sources from almost all Arab countries contributed to the content. Most of the content (43%) was from medical and healthcare professionals and institutions. Definition and classification of epilepsy were the most common topics (21%) within posts and shares. Moreover, seeking information and advice were the dominant types of engagement found among users (32%). Findings of the study suggest that more attention on content for underrepresented topics is required and that enhanced engagement by health professionals and specialists with the users on social media platforms would be beneficial. Implications for current use and available content related to epilepsy on social media, as well as related recommendations, are included. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Paleography is the study of historical writing and its concern with identifying the date, origin, author(s), and other information about a particular script. There are many paleography text analysis system aims to analyze English handwritten text. However, scarcely any of them are proposed to analyze the Arabic handwritten texts. Hence, the Arabic paleographers are forced to manually analyzes the handwritten text. To facilitate and reduce the amount of time required to analyze the scripts for paleographers and archaeologists. An Automatic Paleography Script Recognition (APSR) System for the Arabic language is proposed in this study. The APSR has three main steps: preprocessing, feature extraction using Fast Independent Component Analysis (Fast-ICA), and recognition using Polynomial, Linear, and Gaussian Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. In the proposed system, the images of the scripts are normalized into a uniform size at first. Afterward, the image noise is reduced using Gaussian blur. Subsequently, the script skeleton is extracted using the Erosion operator for feature extraction and selection of the handwritten script using Fast-ICA. The accuracy of the proposed system is evaluated on version 2 of the IFN/ENIT dataset of handwritten Arabic text using Polynomial, Linear, and Gaussian SVM classifiers. Moreover, the accuracy result of the proposed system is compared with the accuracy result produced by a state-of-the-art OHATRS, which is based on Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and SVM classifiers using several normalization sizes of Arabic text images. The experiential result shows the effectiveness of the proposed system compared to the OHATRS model.  © 2021 IEEE.},

To this end, we have oriented our work around a control interface for an Automatic Continuous Speech Recognition System (ACSRS), which we have adapted to the Standard Arabic language. For this, a construction of an Automatic Continuous Speech Recognition System was first undertaken and a link was established with a graphic interface based on HMM (Hidden Models of Markov) and the toolbox HTK (Hidden Markov Model Toolkit). The realization of the proposed interface will avoid the dependency constraint, common in most of the ACSRS (s), and make the system independent of the speakers. On the one hand, the transcription of the sentences recognized by this system will be executed in real time; and on the other hand, the display will be on a screen independent of the system. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Assistive technology enables the disabled cohort of the community to break the barriers to learning, access information, contribute to the community, and live independently. This article proposes an assistive device to enable people with visual disabilities and learning disabilities to access printed Arabic material in real-Time, and to help them participate in the education system and the professional workforce. This proposed assistive device employs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Text To Speech (TTS) conversion, using concatenation synthesis. OCR is achieved using image processing, character extraction, and classification, while Arabic speech synthesis is achieved through concatenation synthesis, followed by Multi Band Re-synthesis Overlap-Add (MBROLA). Waveform generation in the second phase produces vocal output for the disabled user to hear. OCR character and word accuracy tests were conducted for nine Arabic fonts. The results show that six fonts were recognized with over 60% character accuracy and two fonts were recognized with over 88% accuracy. A Mean Opinion Score (MOS) test for speech quality was conducted. The results showed an overall MOS score of 3.53/5 and indicated that users were able to understand the speech. A real-Time usability testing was conducted with 10 subjects. The results showed an overall average of agreements scores of 3.9/5 and indicated that the proposed Arabic reader pen meets the real-Time constraints and is pleasant and satisfying to use and can contribute to make printed Arabic material accessible to visually impaired persons and people with learning disabilities. © 2021 ACM.},

In the post-Soviet period, Russian orientalists drew attention to a number of still insufficiently studied Arabic-language sources. The research work revealed more new sources that significantly changed established ideas about social, legal and military-political history of Dagestan. Extensive study and translations of several historical chronicles, a wide range of various sources from the period of the Caucasian War were introduced into scientific circulation. Systematic work is underway to study the epistolary sources kept both in the Fund of Oriental Manuscripts of the Institute of History, Archeology and Ethnography of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Makhachkala (it includes now thousands of manuscripts and documents) and in numerous private manuscript collections. Studies of Arabic-language written monuments often remain out of sight not only for a wide range of readers, but also for the historians who specialize on the history of the Caucasus.

Therefore, this study aims to investigate gender differences in learning Arabic language proficiency via M-learning among Malaysia university students. This study is a pre-test and post-test quasi experimental study which comprises of 84 males and 189 females in treatment group; and 197 students in control groups. All of the participants are lower beginner Arabic language learners from four universities in peninsular Malaysia which were selected through stratified random sampling technique. The findings revealed that male learners received substantially greater adjusted average scores on the performance test versus females using the same courses. Noticeable correlations between M-learning modes and gender on achievement have been established. In regards, the concepts of M-Learning must be taken into account when developing online learning syllabuses in order to facilitate Arabic language learning. The findings of this study will help lecturers to improve their teaching practices in this era of technology advancement and provide a consideration on gender differences of the preference towards mobile learning practice.  © 2021 JLLS and the Authors-Published by JLLS.},

Numerous such accounts are generated by attackers to achieve multiple nefarious goals, including phishing, spamming, spoofing, and promotion. These practices pose significant challenges regarding the availability of credible data that reflect real-world social media interactions. This has led to the development of various methods and approaches to combat spammers on social media networks. Previous studies, however, have almost exclusively focused on studying and identifying English-language spam profiles, whereas the problem of malicious Arabic-language accounts remains under-addressed in the literature. In this paper, therefore, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of malicious Arabic-language campaigns on Twitter. The study involves analyzing the accounts of these campaigns from several perspectives, including their number, content, social interaction graphs, lifespans, and day-to-day activities. In addition to exposing their spamming tactics, we find that these spam accounts are more successful in avoiding Twitter suspensions that has been previously reported in the literature. © 2021},

The mean score of the Abuse Scale was 159.6 (range 26–390), which was higher than the US version (mean = 91). Internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.911) and test–retest reliability (Pearson's r = 0.89; two-tailed p 0.00) were both high. With regard to the construct validity, the six-factor structure of the original version was not replicated; only three factors were obtained. The interview data showed that the CAPI was easy to complete and appropriate for use in Oman. The Arabic version of the CAPI showed a highly satisfactory internal consistency and test–retest reliability. This suggests that the Arabic version of the CAPI is a valid and reliable tool to use to assess potential for child physical abuse within Oman. These results are in concordance with other cross-cultural versions of the CAPI. ‘Reports on the prevalence of high scores and assessment of reliability and validity of the Arabic CAPI’. Key Practitioner Messages: This research reports a first attempt to assess the psychometric properties of an Arabic version of the CAPI and use it among an Arab Muslim population. The results indicated that the tool is culturally acceptable and appropriate within this context, that mothers are able to complete it, and that it was stable over time. The distribution of CAPI scores showed a higher mean score and a greater proportion of mothers scoring above the original cut-off score. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Therefore, this study aims to explore the impact on the employment of digital game-based learning in Arabic class at the tertiary level. This study is a qualitative study and data obtained through semi-structured interview sessions with 16 students at tertiary level, who exposed to the mobile digital game in learning the Arabic language. The students were chosen purposively based on several determining characteristics. The major findings indicated that the mobile digital game produces a significant effect on their learning achievement and enhances their Arabic vocabulary acquisition. Besides, the digital game-based learning also promotes a student-centred and interactive learning, while additionally creates an enjoyable environment for learning that could encourage student participation in class activities, sustain their learning engagement, and improve their motivation. This study explored opportunities for Arabic language lecturers to practice digital game-based learning as it promotes student-centred learning, which would enhance student’s participation in language activities and provide them with a joyful, fun, and active learning environment. © 2022 by the authors;.},

This target is detected with respect to the source tweet itself and not limited to a set of pre-defined targets which is the usual approach of the current state-of-the-art methods. Our proposed new attitude resulted in a new corpus called ExaASC for the Arabic Language, one of the low resource languages in this field. In the end, we used BERT to evaluate our corpus and reached a 70.69 Macro F-score. This shows that our data and model can work in a general Target-base Stance Detection system.

	abstract = {Verbs play a significant role in the Arabic language. Arab grammarians, from the time of Sîbeveyhî to the present day, have given special importance to verb patterns and their meanings whether they are mücerred (pure) verbs or mezîd (augmented) verbs. Generally, the verbs are studied in grammar books together with nouns and letters but we also see books dedicated to only verbs like the book of Kitâbu fa‘altü ve ef‘altü of Ebû İshâk ez-Zeccâc. In grammar books, verbs have been dealt with under various sub-titles. Ma‘lûm-meçhûl (active-passive), müte‘addî-lâzım (transitive – intransitive), sahîh-mu‘tel (sound-weak) and mutasarrıf-câmid (declinable – indeclinable) can be given as examples of these titles. Another important sub-topic of verbs is mezîd (augmented) verbs and their meanings. One of the meanings that mezîd verbs express is, with the expression of Sîbeveyhî, the subject of mutâva‘at (reflexivity) in which a ma‘lûm (active) verb gains the meaning of meçhul (passive). Verbs expressing mutâva‘at (reflexivity) were used both in religious texts and Arabic poetry and proverbs during the time before Islam (Câhiliyya). In this study, dictionary and lexical meanings of the word mutava‘at, the mezîd (augmented) verbs expressing mutâva‘at (reflexivity) meaning, the forms of the verbs with mutâva‘at (reflexivity), meaning in use, and grammarians’ opinion of mutâva‘at (reflexivity) will be examined in the light of examples from the Quran, Arabic poetry and proverbs. © 2021 ESP Across Cultures.

	abstract = {Purpose: This research was conducted to observe the extent of effectiveness at non-verbal communication in the teaching of Arabic language, which is used by teachers in order to intervene students' performance. Without doubt, teachers play a significant role at ensuring the effectiveness of teaching and learning, as well as its fulfilled objectives. One of the approaches which helps teachers to achieve teaching objectives is the communicative approach. An effective communication depends on the teacher's ability to deliver message either verbally or non-verbally. The use of non-verbal communication along with verbal communication will enhance the effectiveness of teaching delivery and learning. Methodology: This research is quantitative in nature which was carried out on two groups-the treatment and control group among Form 2 students by using Arabic language textbooks, published by the Ministry of Education. This experimental research took place in 12 weeks. Pre and post-Test was done to observe the impact on students' achievement where later mean score and t-Test was conducted on the results. Main Findings: Findings from t-Test reveals an obvious improvement among the students from the treatment group as compared to those in the control group. Achivement among the treatment group shows the effectiveness of using non-verbal communication as part of teaching and learning Arabic language. This findings is hoped to equip teachers at providing attention to the use of non-verbal communication in the process of teaching and learning. Applications: Findings revealed the applied translating strategies are literal translating, transposition, synonyms, omission, reduction, functional matching and cultural matching. Based on the selected samples, the application of literal translating is the highes. © 2020 Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt. Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This formulation needs the knowledge of the model and the structure of the database. However, non-expert users cannot write such queries. This is why a lot of works have been developed to query the database in natural language. Historically, most of these works were carried out for English language and they were designed for a specific database model. Some of them function independently of database domain. But, until now there is no system that functions independently of both database model and domain. For the Arabic language, all existing contributions are dependent on database domain and model. This paper presents a generic natural language interface to query databases using the Arabic language. This interface functions independently of the database domain and model (relational and XML). Furthermore, the use of machine learning helps our system to improve its knowledge base automatically through experience. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

In the current study, we ought to examine the effect of this strategy in the Arab community in Israel, and its consequences on reading comprehension of Arabic language. In order to examine this issue, a quasi-experimental method through practical application of educational units constructed in accordance with the strategic elements of RT was conducted. Sixty-one students from secondary public schools participated in this study. The participants served as two groups: experimental group and a control group. The results showed that there is a significant difference in the levels of metacognitive reading comprehension (self-monitoring, planning of task parameters, and assessment of strategy) between the two groups. The reciprocal teaching strategy had a clear impact on the students' skills and improved their level of comprehension of the texts. Further, the study confirmed that metacognitive reading comprehension dimensions depend upon the extent of students' exposure to strategies and skills that give them the ability to interact with texts. Recommendations for the implementation of RT to benefit students are suggested, especially in the context of Arab population. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose: A simple measure to assess drug adherence in Saudi patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is required. The aim of this study was to translate and validate the 5-Item Compliance Questionnaire for Rheumatology (CQR5) into Arabic. Patients and Methods: The questionnaire was translated and culturally adapted to Arab patients in six steps: initial translation, synthesis of the translation, back translation, expert committee review, test of the pre-final version, and development of the Arabic CQR5 (ACQR-5). The resulting version was tested for validity in patients with RA. Results: A total of 103 adult patients with RA were recruited from rheumatology clinics at a university hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. After extensive translation, the final tool (CQR) was piloted in 15 patients. The final validation was performed with 88 patients. Of these, 80 (90.9%) were female and 43.2% were seropositive. The mean (±SD) age and disease duration were 50 (±13) and 11.4 (±8.2) years, respectively. Cronbach’s alpha reliability was 0.886, and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy for factor analysis was 0.870 (p<0.001). The mean ACQR-5 was 17.78 (2.70), with 14 (15.9%) classified as low adherents and the remaining 74 (84.1%) as high adherents. Binary logistic regression revealed that increasing age (odds ratio [OR] 1.082, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.025–1.142, p=0.005) and a trend toward the presence of other comorbidities (OR 3.111, 95% CI: 0.961–10.070, p=0.058) were associated with low adherence. Conclusion: ACQR-5 is a simple and feasible tool for identifying adherence levels in patients with RA in Saudi Arabia. A high level of adherence was observed in this study. Additional studies are required to assess ACQR-5 validity and adherence levels in a larger, more diverse population. © 2021 Omair et al.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the most frequent countries and prevalent discourses in the context of homosexuality in the headlines of Arabic-language media outlets. Design/methodology/approach: This study combined both corpus linguistic (CL) quantitative and critical discourse analysis (CDA) qualitative approaches to analyse five thousand two hundred news headlines that were retrieved from the Factiva news database from 2010 to 2019. Findings: There were six main categories of subjects covered by the media in the context of homosexuality, namely crime, extremist groups, legislation, authority figures and scandals, culture and countries. The analysis showed that the countries whose laws criminalize homosexuals were more frequent than those seen to be supportive of homosexuals. The findings revealed that homosexuals are under-covered in the Arab media, and whenever they are present in the news reports, they are depicted negatively. Research limitations/implications: This study examined the representation of homosexuals in Arabic headlines from 2010 to 2019. Future researchers may investigate their construction in the body of the articles in different periods and languages. Practical implications: The present research has implications regarding the necessity of objectivity in covering news about minority groups without being influenced by the stock of ideas circulating in the culture where media outlets report. Social implications: The social implications include enhancing the principles and values of solidarity and respecting all groups in society. Originality/value: Although there is considerable literature on the representation of homosexuals in media outlets, the number of articles that investigated the same concept in the Arab region is relatively limited to the best knowledge of the researchers. Therefore, this study can add great significance to existing knowledge as it tackles a limitedly investigated topic in the Arab world. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In addition to examining the similarities and/or differences of themes found in the Arabic language women’s magazines in these two Arab societies, this study also aims to compare the themes in these magazines to those found in locally produced English language women’s magazines in the Middle East, as established in previous studies. The initial hypothesis of the researchers was that the different languages and the different readership of these magazines would be major factors accounting for possible differences. Fifteen articles from the relationship advice sections of each magazine were selected for this study. Both semantic and latent approaches were used in the analysis of themes in order to analyse not just what is foregrounded by these texts but also what is backgrounded or omitted. The findings of the study reveal that despite the difference in language and readership, themes such as the primacy of marriage and the narrative of love and affection towards husbands appear to be integral to women’s magazines published in the Middle East, either in Arabic or in English. However, there are some subtle differences in how these themes are expressed in the magazines. This fact clearly illustrates the need for a more nuanced discussion on gender and sexuality in the Middle East in order to minimise the perpetuation of stereotypical constructs of Arab women. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

The principal challenges for this task are: first, the ambiguity (when a word can take several possible tags), and secondly the problem of rare words (in particular, words that did not appear in the training examples). In the past few years, the Neural Part of Speech Tagging has achieved competitive results with the use of deep learning, and this paper aims, thus, to provide an addition to the literature by the usage of Character-Level Convolution networks on Arabic language. We have experimentally implemented our model on the Boundary-Annotated Quran (BAQ) dataset, and we used the augmentation techniques to enhance the accuracy of the ID convolutional neural network by adding handcrafted features. The results show ID convolutional neural networks with a handcrafted feature outperformed, where we achieved a training accuracy of 97.04 % where the model without handcrafted features achieved 96.95 %. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

	abstract = {Purpose - Even though tahfiz education has been developing tremendously, tahfiz students' achievement in memorising the Quran is still not very encouraging. Weakness in understanding the meaning of Quranic phrases is believed to be one of the reasons for this shortcoming. Despite numerous studies, a knowledge gap still exists regarding the factors underpinning the problem of understanding the Quran. At the same time, several Islamic scholars have emphasised on the teaching of Arabic in the tahfiz education system. Thus, this research explored the importance of Arabic language schemata in predicting memorisation achievement through the understanding of the Quran. Methodology - Utilising a quantitative approach, this research explored the influence of Arabic language schemata on memorisation achievement among tahfiz students with knowledge of the Arabic language. The mediating factor investigated was the understanding of the Quran. The research was conducted on a sample of 246 students from four Malaysian tahfiz institutions that required students to possess Arabic language schemata at Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (Malaysian Certificate of Education) level. Data collection was carried out through testing techniques to measure the Arabic language schemata level, comprising ‘nahu’ (Arabic syntax), ‘saraf’ (Arabic morphology) and vocabulary, the level of understanding of the Quran and also memorisation achievement. Findings - The results of the analysis using Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and Bootstrapping procedure showed that Arabic language schemata had direct and indirect effects on memorisation achievement through the understanding of the Quran. Significance - The findings clarify that Arabic language schemata and understanding the Quran are relevant predicting factors in memorisation achievement. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.},

(2008) data language technologies for lifelong learning along with the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaires (MSLQ) amongst 317 Arabic learners to six selected universities. They carried out quantitative data analysis by using SPSS and SmartPLS. The finding reported that these learners SMU displayed a significant correlation with motivation. A variation in the results was noted according to the year of study for all the learners. Furthermore, the results indicated that self-efficacy showed a varying effect on the academic performance of the students. The researchers discussed the results related to the learning of a language and the educational practices which were implemented. The results of this study could benefit the instructors, faculty and the student population. © 2020, Universitas Negeri Makassar- Faculty of Languages and Literature. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Performing natural language processing on a text document is an active research area. Social media includes valuable information resources in various languages. These information resources include reviews, comments, tweets, posts, opinions, articles and other text resources which could be analysed to explore people's opinions, attitudes, emotions and sentiments towards various subjects and commodities. However, there is lack of contributions addressing sentiment analysis on automobile reviews in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) dialects and in the Arabic language in general. Moreover, the lack of available annotated datasets in the Arabic language, which are targeting specific domains (such as automobiles), and the limited focus on analysing the sentiments in Arabic regional dialects created a gap. These factors motivated us to conduct the research that we report in this paper. Furthermore, the limited adoption of techniques and algorithms related to natural language processing and machine learning is noticed in the current efforts that are targeting sentiment analysis in the Arabic language, which once adopted could provide the opportunity of enhancing the performance of sentiment analysers. Therefore, this research attempts to cover these gaps to a certain extent. Copyright © 2020 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda. All rights reserved},

	abstract = {Objectives Health literacy research in Palestine is limited, and a locally validated tool for use among adolescents has been unavailable until now. Therefore, this study aimed to adapt health literacy assessment scale for adolescents (HAS-A) into Arabic language (HAS-A-AR) and Palestinian context and to investigate its psychometric properties. Design We conducted a cross-sectional household survey using a stratified random sample and household face-to-face interviews. Setting and participants We conducted 1200 interviews with sixth to ninth graders in the Ramallah and al-Bireh district of the West Bank, Palestine in 2017. Methods We translated and adapted HAS-A to be sensitive to the Palestinian context and tested its psychometric properties. We evaluated face and content validity during the back-translation process and checked for construct validity through exploratory factor analysis (EFA). We tested for internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha, MacDonald's omega test and the greatest lower bound (GLB). Furthermore, we calculated the scale's average inter-item correlation. Results EFA revealed that HAS-A-AR has a similar structure to the original HAS-A. It extracted three factors (communication, confusion and functional health literacy) whose eigenvalues were >1. Together they explained 57% of the total variance. The proportions of adolescents with high levels of communication, confusion and functional health literacy were 45%, 68% and 80%, respectively. Cronbach's alpha, MacDonald's omega and the GLB values for communication subscale were 0.87, 0.88 and 0.90, and they were 0.78, 0.77 and 0.79 for confusion subscale, while they were 0.77, 0.77 and 0.80, respectively, for functional healthy literacy subscale. The average inter-item correlation for the subscales ranged between 0.36 and 0.59. Conclusion HAS-A-AR is a valid and reliable health literacy measuring instrument with appropriate psychometric properties. HAS-A-AR is currently available for use among adolescents in Palestine and the surrounding Arab countries with similar characteristics as Palestine, including language, culture and political instability.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Recently, recurrent neural networks based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) cells are successfully used in various solutions for the Arabic language. However, these networks are complex and require long training times on large datasets. In this paper, we present an investigation for fast alternatives to the commonly used bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) layers. As case studies, we evaluate alternative networks for two Arabic applications: classifying poems and diacritizing text. We concentrate in this paper on networks based on the CUDA deep neural network (CuDNNLSTM) layer for its many advantages. We present thorough performance evaluation of BiLSTM and BiCuDNNLSTM networks including model complexity, training time, and accuracy for both applications. We recommend BiCuDNNLSTM networks as alternative for BiLSTM networks because they improve training time by 65 and 21 times for poem classification and diacritization, respectively. Moreover, the BiCuDNNLSTM networks provide similar or higher accuracies (99.16% vs. 98.41 % for diacritization). The advantage of this recommend layer originates from its efficient utilization of the GPU.  © 2021 IEEE.},

Then, the article looks at the specific case of Jordan, providing an historical overview on how nationalism, religion, and religious pluralism played a part in Jordanian educational and political strategies. The following section specifically focuses on the use of the Arabic language in the Islamic and national perspectives, providing a diachronic comparison between the 2013 Arabic Language Curriculum and the 2019 General Frame for Jordanian Curricula, integrated by references to textbook content materials. The article identifies pragmatic needs behind the highlighted teaching policies and contextualizes the analyses in the broader Jordanian historical and political frameworks, pointing at the relevance of the Arabic language for the construction of identities in the contemporary Middle East and at its enduring politicization. Comparison between the 2013 and the 2019 documents shows relevant changes between past and present formulations, namely in the reduced emphasis on the link between language and religion.

	abstract = {Everything in the world is reflected in a language, because the language is an invaluable wealth, which determines the spiritual culture and worldview of any nation, its intellectual and moral development. Many linguistic problems are associated with the development and movement of the language system and especially the lexical subsystem, which remains unresolved up to this day. These problems include the little-studied area of Bashkir linguistics - Bashkir philosophical language, an unexplored area on the periphery of linguistics and philosophy. The topicality of the problem of nationality in Bashkir philosophy is due to the fact that the sovereignization of public life requires the development of ethnic and national self-awareness, a theoretical understanding of fundamentals and tendencies of the national worldview. This is an extremely multifaceted subject of study. In addition, the history of the Bashkir national social-philosophical thought itself still has a lot of "white spots" and needs considerable replenishment and renewal. The objective of the article is to study the specifics of the Bashkir philosophical language, which allows to understand Bashkir cultural traditions, ethnic, and national identity, its originality and specificity, as well as the influence of Arabic and Arabic-Islamic philosophy, which have a huge role in the development of Bashkir philosophy, its essence and content. In this article we used the descriptive and comparative methods of study and methods of semantic analysis of linguistic material. It is determined that the Bashkir philosophical language does not have a certain strict canonical form, mainly associated with specifics of the author's thought, that belong to either scientific, or artistic, or religious discourse. A huge impact on the development of Bashkir philosophical thought and Bashkir philosophical language was made by Arabic-Islamic philosophy, which began to penetrate into the inner world of the Bashkir people along with Islam. © 2020 Transilvanian Association for the Literarure and Culture of Romanian People (ASTRA).

We focused on the role of metaphor in constructing our experience of cancer, and examined which metaphors are more frequent in the construction of the cancer experience. The results of the study revealed that there is a great similarity between Arabic and English in respect of the metaphors used to construct the cancer experience; the patients have framed their cancer situation via WAR and/or JOURNEY metaphors, with War metaphors more frequently used than Journey Metaphors. The findings also indicate that the Arabic narratives tended to include a stronger religious framework, constructing cancer as a kind of Trial by Ordeal in which one proves one's firm faith through patience and acceptance of fate.  © 2022 Hessah Shajaan Abaalalaa and Wesam M.

The rapid spread of social media websites is accompanied with an increasing number of social media users which showed a higher rate of hate speech, as well. The objective of this paper is to propose a smart deep learning approach for the automatic detection of cyber hate speech. Particularly, the detection of hate speech on Twitter on the Arabic region. Hence, a dataset is collected from Twitter that captures the hate expressions in different topics at the Arabic region. A set of features extracted from the dataset based on a word embedding mechanism. The word embeddings fed into a deep learning framework. The implemented deep learning approach is a hybrid of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The proposed approach achieved good results in classifying tweets as Hate or Normal regarding accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 measure.

The research results show that the ALRM subjects development based on online learning through learning network is very effective both from the quality of the product and from the aspects of the process and learning outcomes. The main factor that causes the effectiveness of this product is the flexibility of time and place which can psychologically create a condition of student affection filters to be low or loose. The relaxation of the affection filter is marked by a sense of pleasure, excitement, and comfort in learning. The implication of this online-based learning system is that teaching materials that are equipped with specific and measurable indicators, assignments and tests are more easily understood by students. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Applications of deep learning depend mainly on large training sets. In some cases a large data set is hardly found due to domain data rarity, data collection constraints and cost, or complicated data preparation and preprocessing. Deep transfer learning aims at exploiting the knowledge learned by a deep learning architecture to conduct another task in another domain. The problem of insufficient data for training in a target domain is manipulated by taking advantage of similar data, data distribution, network or task from a source domain. Both domains need to be related however they are different. Arabic emotion detection (ED) is a field characterized by lack of resources and available training sets are small for a deep learning implementation. On the other hand, applied deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for sentiment analysis (SA) have reported enhanced results over the state-of-the-art. In this paper a deep CNN model is proposed for Arabic sentiment analysis based on character level representation. In addition, the model is used for applying Transfer Learning (TL) between sentiment analysis and emotion detection domains in Arabic language. The application intended to use Arabic character level features representation learned from a large sentiment data set to apply Arabic emotion detection. The implementation showed more enhanced performance in ED in terms of the accuracy measure. © 2019 IEEE.},

In parallel to this, voices calling for giving Dialectal Arabic the status of the official state language and cancelling Standard Arabic altogether are becoming louder. This debate is being fuelled by the rapidly developing theory of superdiversity which claims that, due to the rapid changes that happened to the world after 1991, and increasing globalization associated with worldwide migration, easy access throughout the world to internet and social networks, video hosting services and satellite television, societies all over the world have become extremely diverse linguistically. This theory also draws on language ideologies, the concept that suggests that the traditional idea of a "language"is an ideological artefact. Is this approach valid for understanding what is happening in the Arabic language? I will attempt to answer this question by examining the status of the Arabic language on the margins of the Arab world - in Zanzibar. For centuries, the Arabic language has been one of the key languages spoken in Zanzibar, but it has now been practically replaced by Swahili.  © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Background. Skin diseases are frequently the reason for social rejection. Therefore, the assessment of stigmatization level in patients suffering from dermatoses plays a crucial role in providing proper health service. Objectives. The aim of this study was to create and validate Arabic language versions of stigmatization instruments - the 6-item Stigmatization Scale and the Feelings of Stigmatization Questionnaire. Material and methods. Development of the Arabic language versions was done with international standards of forward-back translations. The validation was performed on 39 psoriatic individuals. The group included 11 females and 28 males. The subjects were asked to fill out both questionnaires: The 6-item Stigmatization Scale and the Feelings of Stigmatization Questionnaire (Arabic language versions) at the time of examination and 7 days after enrollment for reassessment to evaluate test-retest reliability. During the first visit the patients additionally filled out an already existing Arabic version of Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), which was used as a reference questionnaire. Results. The results concerning the integrity of instruments were very good, and the Cronbach's α coefficient for both scales was 0.89. The reproducibility level assessed with interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) stood at 0.91 for the 6-item Stigmatization Scale and 0.92 for the Feelings of Stigmatization Questionnaire. There was a strong correlation between total score of the 6-item Stigmatization Scale and DLQI. Significant negative moderate correlation was documented between the Feelings of Stigmatization Questionnaire and DLQI. Moreover, both stigmatization instruments correlated significantly with each other. Conclusions. The developed Arabic language versions of the abovementioned stigmatization instruments can be successfully used in daily clinical practice as well as in clinical research. © 2019 by Wroclaw Medical University.},

Sentiment analysis aims to determine the overall sentiment orientation of a speaker or writer towards a specific entity or towards a specific feature of a specific entity. A fundamental task of sentiment analysis is sentiment classification, which aims to automatically classify opinionated text as being positive, negative, or neutral. Although the literature on sentiment classification is quite extensive, only a few endeavors to classify opinionated text written in the Arabic language can be found. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of existing lexicon, machine learning, and hybrid sentiment classification techniques for Arabic language. © 2016 IEEE.},

Learners may gain confidence when given a proper and clear role in role play which enhances their motivation levels. This study adopts Byram (2004) resultative and motivational hypothesis and Eccles et al. (1983) Expectancy-Value theory as underlying theories to investigate the relationship between attitude toward role play and subjective role play value to account for Arabic language proficiency. The data were analyzed using more recent confirmatory analysis which is now available in SmartPLS 3.2.6 called consistent PLS (PLSc). Using a sample of 331 students from UiTM campuses at Kelantan, Terengganu and Pahang, the analysis showed that these theories support a sound framework for predicting Arabic language proficiency. Additionally, Arabic language proficiency was significantly influenced by attitude towards role play and subjective role play value. Attitude toward role play and subjective role play value are found to be positively influencing Arabic language proficiency. The R2 was measured as 0.308 for Arabic language proficiency. Therefore, it is believed that these findings will be considered as a useful source of information to lecturers, teachers, institutions, and management in supporting role play practices and thus enhancing Arabic language proficiency among UiTM students. © 2019 Conscientia Beam.

Fuzzy logic in the field of sentiment analysis can be employed to classify the polarity of sentences or documents. Although some efforts have been made by researchers who applied fuzzy logic for Sentiment Analysis on English texts, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, no efforts have been made targeting Arabic texts. This paper proposes a lexicon based approach to extract sentiment polarity from Arabic text using a fuzzy logic approach. The proposed approach consists of two main phases. In the first phase, Arabic text is assigned weights, while in the second phase fuzzy logic is employed to assign the polarity to the inputted sentence. Experiments were conducted on Large Scale Arabic Book Reviews Dataset (LABR), and the results showed 94.87%, 84.04%, 80.59% and 89.13% for recall, precision, accuracy, and F1-measure, respectively. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

However, there is a shortage of databases with Arabic samples. In this work, a new database of printed Arabic text is introduced. The new concept of collecting sub-words (PAWs) instead of words or individual character samples was adopted. These PAWs constitute all words in the Arabic language. The collected database consists of 83,056 images of PAWs extracted from approximately 550,000 different words. Each sample is presented in the database in five font types: Thuluth, Naskh, Andalusi, Typing Machine, and Kufi. In total, the database consists of 415,280 images. Moreover, ground truth information is included with each PAW image to describe its occurrence number, occurrence frequency, positions and the shapes of the characters.

Therefore, we propose, in this paper, a prosodic study between the various types of sentences in the standard Arabic language. The sentences are recognized according to three modalities as the following: declarative, interrogative and exclamatory sentences. The results of this study will be used to synthesize the different types of pronunciation that can be exploited in several domains namely the man-machine communication. To this end, we developed a specific dataset, consisting of the three types of sentences. Then, we tested two sets of features: prosodic features (Fundamental Frequency, Energy and Duration) and spectrum features (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients and Linear Predictive Coding) as well their combination. We adopted the Multi-Class Support Vector Machine (MC-SVM) as classifier. The experimental results are very encouraging. © 2019, Zarka Private University. All rights reserved.},

This that more is available, it becomes more difficult to extract the relevant information. To meet this challenge, many researchers are directed to the development of information retrieval systems based on syntactic and semantic parsing. In Arabic, this field is restricted by the lack of labeled datasets. Thus, it is important to build systems for part-of-speech tagging and language modeling and use their results for further syntactic and semantic parsing in fields like chunking, semantic role labeling, information extraction, named entity recognition and statistical machine translation. Deep neural networks have proved efficient in fields like imaging or acoustics and recently in natural language processing. In this study, we used the Taguchi method to find the optimal parameter combination for a deep neural network architecture. Therefore, the neural network obtained the most accurate results. The main use of the Taguchi method in our work is to help us to choose the best context which is the number of words before and after the word on which the training is made. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Steganography is one of the important techniques in this field. In particular, statistical text steganography is classified as an immune technique against the majority of steganalysis techniques compared to other steganography techniques. On the other hand, although Arabic is the official language of many countries, many steganography techniques remain unexplored for it. In this work, we implemented a Markov Chain (MC) encoder/decoder combined with Huffman Coding (HC) for Arabic text steganography. Additionally, we computed an upper bound and a lower bound for the stego-text length that depends on the designed encoder/decoder parameters. The proposed Arabic steganography technique capacity performance was investigated for different encoder parameters and secret message length. We found that applying some constraints on the MC increases the embedding capacity till it reaches an upper limit floor. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: This study investigated the psychometric properties of the recently developed Qiyas for L1 Arabic language test using a Rasch measurement framework. Methods: Responses from 271 examinees were analyzed in this study. The test is hypothesized to involve one dominant factor that assesses four skills: reading comprehension, rhetorical expression, structure, and writing accuracy. Results: Fit statistics and reliability analysis, principal component analysis of Rasch residuals, and the results of differential item functioning supported the hypothesized structure of the Qiyas for L1 Arabic language test. However, the results of a person-item map analysis suggested that the content aspect validity of the Qiyas for L1 Arabic language test lacked representation to some extent. Conclusion: The initial findings of the Rasch analysis indicated that the Qiyas for L1 Arabic language test maintains satisfactory psychometric properties. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution given the limitations of the sample population used. Continued investigation of the psychometric proprieties of the test is necessary to ensure its appropriate use as a tool of assessment for modern Arabic language. © 2018, The Author(s).},

In the Arab world, there is a persistent need for the Arabic spoken language recognition To help those who have lost the upper parties in doing what they want through speech computer interaction. While, the Arabic automatic speech recognition (AASR) did not receive the desired attention from the researchers. In this paper, the Radial Basis Function (RBF) is used for the improvement of the Arabic spoken language letter. The recognition and classification process are based on three steps; these are; preprocessing, feature extraction and classification (Recognition). The Arabic Language Letters (ALL) recognition is done by using the combination between the statistical features and the Temporal Radial Basis Function for different letter situation and noisy condition. The recognition percent are from 90% - 99.375% has been gained with independent speaker, where these results are over-perform the earlier works by nearly 2.045%.

In the history of Islamic civilization, the primary language of communication is Arabic. Thus, the key to understanding the sources of Islamic civilization, Al Quran and hadith, is understanding Arabic. Understanding the linguistic elements of Arabic language is necessary to understanding Islamic Jurisprudence. However, differences of opinions amongst Islamic scholars brings about the question whether each scholars apply different linguistic methodology when making conclusions of a jurisprudence. This paper looks into Imam Shafi'i’s methodology in text analysis of Arabic language when determining an Islamic jurisprudence. The findings reveal that a strong proficiency in Arabic language is necessary before determining an Islamic law. It is a prerequisite for a person to be proficient in the Arabic language to become a mujtahid. Imam Shafi'i is a renowned mujtahid is qualified for ijtihad because of his proficiency in the Arabic language. Thus his methodology of text linguistic of Arabic language in determining an Islamic jurisprudence reduces any disputes and differences in determining an Islamic jurisprudence. © IAEME Publication.},

But on the other hand, Arabic language is characterized by an interesting property; lemmas are generated by derivation based on roots and schemes. Schemes are kinds of molds allowing changing the form of root by actions involving elongation, or repetition, or even adding characters. Schemes can also give meaning to generated word. In this work we have studied the statistical characteristics of the Arabic language at the level of schemes; we have emphasized the attenuation of the sparseness at this level. Then we explored the possibility of building natural language processing tools for Arabic by relying on schemes. We discovered that schemes have great potential in building accurate natural language processing tools for Arabic. Based entirely or partially on schemes we built an n-scheme statistical model and a text classification system. © 2015 IEEE.},

The main idea of Fuad Sezgin is that al-Bukhārī did not only rely on oral sources but also on written sources when he created the al-Jāmi al-Sahīh. Therefore, Arabic Language Literature in the first three centuries has to be investigated and compared with al-Kutub al-Sitta to reach a final conclusion. In this article, the claims of Fuad Sezgin will be extended and discussed in this respect. In order to verify the authenticity of these claims, the ahadith and the chain system of the al-Basra and al-Kūfa Arabic Language books will be determined. If the ahādīth given in these sources comes before the al-Kutub al-Sitta, this means that we can reach earlier sources about the ahādīth given in al-Kutub al-Sitta. In addition, the method of using the hadith in the these sources, the hadīth chains and the possible tariqs will be examined in a chronological and comparative way. ©Yazarlar.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we review the historical and cultural worldliness of the Khartoum Arabic Language Academy with a focus on its linguistic ideology of operation and discursive representation. The paper has three key objectives: first, to show that Arabic language academies emerged as decolonising institutions in a context of struggle to fix the ‘image’ of Arabic through specific textual practices of representation. We inspect how the naturalising effect of the dominant institutional ideology of Arabic relies on its capacity to function through other discourses. As a second objective, we contend that since the cultural policy of Arabicisation is closely linked with institutional power and subjectivity, it dialectically contributes to the maintenance of less officially recognised linguistic resources as significant proxies in the discursive struggle for recognition. Our third objective is to compare and contrast the Khartoum Arabic Language Academy with the Higher Commission for Arabicisation in the Sudan. Our argument here is that as an effect of the contestation over what counts as ‘Arabic’, Arabicisation is always an incomplete process. Our analysis of the cultural political world of the Khartoum Arabic Language Academy draws on the insights and conceptual tools provided by historical and discourse studies. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

This research is the first one in the field. Research on the integration of humour in the study of Arabic language as first language does not exist so far. There are very few studies dealing with the integration of humour in the learning process of Arabic as a second language (only three were found). Hence, there are no studies dealing with the integration of humour in the educational field in the Israeli Arab sector. The research took place in one school in the Bedouin sector in the South of Israel. It was based on one experimental class and one control class The study examined the level of the pupils' knowledge in all components of comprehension: explicit and implicit content, interpretation and integration, evaluating texts and drawing conclusions. The experimental classes studied six humorous stories whereas the control classes studied six stories without humour. The results of the experiment show that the achievements of pupils who learned comprehension using humorous stories was much higher than those in the control classes. In addition, a more positive learning environment was reported in the experimental classes. © Cracow Tertium Society for the Promotion of Language Studies.},

It is also one of the main languages spoken in the world with thousands of people in various Arab countries using it as their mother tongue. However, despite its richness, the Arabic language does not yet have a historical dictionary which helps to understand the language, its richness, its origins and its evolution. The historical dictionary aims at overseeing the compilation of a historical lexicon of the Arabic language and its development over the last two millennia. To create such a dictionary, we must follow many steps. As part of these steps is the extraction of the appropriate meaning of a given word occurring in a given context, also called word sense disambiguation (WSD). Indeed, the evolution of the Arabic language from antiquity to the present days has given birth to several linguistic registers ascribed to the great periods of the history of the Arabic language. They can be classified as: Old Arabic, Classical Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic. In this work, we propose a method that aims to disambiguate words in Modern Standard Arabic. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This study aims at revealing the reasons behind foreigners’ interest in learning Arabic language. In fact, the search for modern creative means for teaching Arabic language prompts foreign students to readily accept them to enable us in the modern age world that is characterized by the availability and accessibility of information to rely on media technologies, digital technology, and multimedia. This study focuses on the significance of multiple intelligences theory in teaching Arabic language for several reasons to facilitate the process of language acquisition for students. Such theory points out that each student has unique multiple intelligences and different ways to learn. It entails that language learning and acquisition is associated with the learning methods that vary from one person to another. The current study seeks to observe the methods of teaching Arabic language for non-native speakers as well as the different types of teaching methods that differ among teachers, along with students’ responses and motivations. The study raises the following questions: how the teaching methods employed for encouraging students enable them to be creative? How can the teacher enhance students' motivation to learn Arabic language? and how can the teacher employ multiple intelligences for teaching Arabic language for non-Arabic speakers? For this objective, descriptive and analytical research are used for describing the phenomenon and highlighting its reasons that led to its emergence, followed by analyzing and its effects and consequences. Finally, the study provides suggestions to accept and adapt language learning. Most important, such approach attempts to cover the general and private motives for learning Arabic among foreigners. It assumes that such motives might be integrative, religious motive, complementary, beneficial or functional motives. © 2019 Global Research Online. All rights reserved.},

First, we give a theoretical study on the plausible anomalies, such as inconsistency, incoherence, redundancy, and incompleteness. Second, we detail the approach that we propose for the automatic detection of such anomalies. Finally, we report on an experiment carried out on an available normalized dictionary of the Arabic language.

This phenomenon increased the potential source of plagiarism. Its detection is a challenge especially in the case of Arabic paraphrase because of the semantic ambiguity of this language. In recent decades, researches have been hindered by the very limited availability of well-structured datasets. In this context, our main objectives are focused on constructing a corpus for Arabic and presenting thereafter its impact for identifying paraphrase. Indeed, we generated the suspect documents from the Open Source Arabic Corpora (OSAC). Distributed word representation (word2vec) and part-of-speech methods were useful for replacing each original word by its most similar one that had the same grammatical class. Moreover, we captured the structure of Arabic sentences with different window sizes and vector dimensions. Then, we studied how this corpus could be used efficiently in the evaluation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods (i.e. Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), word2vec, Global Vector Representation (GloVe), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)) for paraphrase detection. Experiments revealed which one could outperformed significantly for preserving semantic properties of Arabic words with various linear regularities, alleviating data sparseness and increasing the degree of semantic similarity, in terms of precision and recall. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

This is a research and development study which involves a process to develop and validate educational product conducted at MAN 2 Bandar Lampung. This study employs the modified model of development proposed by Hannafin and Peck which consists of three phases: (1) needs analysis; (2) design; and (3) development/implementation. This research produces a product in the form of mobile learning media for Arabic learning at Islamic Senior High School (Madrasah Aliyah) with an offline operational system using a smartphone (Android). The product development process was done using Construct 2 software and Cocoon.io on the https://www.cocoon.io/. The product feasibility was validated by the material expert with the score of 4.85 or 97.14%, by the media expert with the score of 5 of 100%, and by the expert of instructional design with the score of 4.6 or92%. This means that all these three validations belong to the highly feasible category. The effectiveness of the product was tested using the t-test with a significant level of α = 0.05. Based on the result of calculations using the t-test, the obtained values of tcritical and ttablearetcritical = 14.342> ttable = 2.086 with the differences in learning outcomes amounting 49.04462. It can be concluded that the mobile learning media of Arabic learning is very suitable to be used in learning and very effective to improve students’ learning outcome. Compared to the previous studies, this current research comes up with relatively new ideas in terms of involving the four language skills in Arabic learning as well as the interactive quizzes for those skills.

	abstract = {Textbooks are major organizers of Arabic language instruction in most Arab countries (Faour, 2012). Textbooks approved by ministries of education have traditionally guided teaching of content knowledge, skills, and values to be taught at each grade level (Faour, 2012; Sabella, 2014; Taha-Thomure, 2008). This research is a foundation study into the use of Arabic Language Arts (ALA) standards in six schools in three countries in the Arabian Gulf region (Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates). Fifty-eight teachers used the ALA standards adapted from the Ohio English Language Arts standards (Taha, 2017a) for at least one year. Results of the online survey indicated that 83.5% of teachers found the standards had a positive effect on their teaching, while 94.9% of teachers found that the standards helped them collaborate with each other in planning and finding suitable resources to use. This suggests that well-supported innovations can lead to teachers being aware of and using ALA to improve student learning and instruction. Results also highlight some of the challenges teachers faced to find the necessary Arab language resources that will help them implement a standards-based approach, in addition to the amount of time they needed to put into preparing for the lessons. © The Author(s) 2018.},

Highly intelligent applications such as Chatbots are the future, which are used to add a value to the user’s experience in various domains not limited to e-commerce, gaming or education sectors. The main role of these Chatbots is to simulate human conversation to answer the users’ questions and fulfill their needs using artificial intelligent algorithms, natural language processing techniques and knowledge base. In recent years, number of different Chatbots were deployed to accomplish different goals in order to help companies to increase their sales and profits. Due to rapid changing environment and increasing demand, Chatbot development frameworks and platforms were created to assist people without any technical background to build a Chatbot easily and rapidly. But in the Arabic world, comparatively less attention has been given to this area where Chatbot applications are still in the beginning stage and immature due to number of reasons including the complexity of Arabic language. This paper presents the review of some existing Chatbot development frameworks and platforms and their support for Arabic language and discusses their support level for the developer in building the Arabic Chatbot as compared to support for other languages like English and French. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

Starting from the Chicano writer Gloria E. Anzaldúa's statements about the use of different languages as presented in Borderland/La frontera, the author will argue that Soueif's strategy is a powerful tool that challenges the British presence in Egypt at the time of colonialism and move on to analyze the influence of the English language used in the novel. Soueif's bilingual writing (English/Arabic) can be thus perceived as an instance of adaptation of one's mother tongue to the surrounding linguistic environment, as well as a tool of empowerment. The English-writing author Soueif allows the Arabic language emerge in her narrative especially when dealing with historical issues, therefore reassessing the Arab national identity in Egypt and overcoming what seems to be linguistic "colonialism". After describing the author's cultural background, the author will propose certain examples of this kind of writing and/or transcultural translation which represents an act of resistance as opposed to the standardised trend of the English language. © 2018 FOKUS Forum za interkulturnu komunikaciju.

Flow is often associated with high levels of performance and is a positive psychological experience. Aim: Our study aimed to validate the “Academic Flow Scale” (Flow 4D 16) in Arabic language across Tunisian population, and to test its factor structure, in terms of internal consistency/reliability, predictive validity, and sensitivity. Methods: The population is composed of 320 students (139 men and 181 women) belonging to the University of Sfax, with a mean age of 22.26 years. The students voluntarily responded to the scale of academic flow (Flow 4D 16). Both exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory (CFA) factor analyses were performed. Results: The four-dimensional alpha coefficients of the Flow 4D 16 indicate an excellent internal consistency, respectively, of 0.902 (Cognitive), 0.959 (Time), 0.974 (Ego) and 0.960 (Well-being). The CFA fit indices were satisfactory. Conclusion: In summary, the 16-items model (original version) showed for all the indices an excellent fit to the theoretical model, confirming the four-dimensional factor structure among Tunisian student population. © Copyright © 2019 Chalghaf, Azaiez, Krakdiya, Guelmami, Re, Maldonado Briegas, Zerbetto, Del Puente, Garbarino, Bragazzi and Azaiez.},

To achieve the study objectives, the researchers developed a content-based VTM and achievement test to measure Arabic language oral skills. Reliability and validity of the study instruments were checked. To answer the study questions, means and standard deviations were calculated, and ANCOVA test was used. Study results revealed that there were statistically significant differences (α=0.05) between means of students' achievement test scores attributed to teaching method variable, and in favor of the experimental group. Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences (α=0.05) between means of students' achievements test scores attributed to gender variable, and the interaction between teaching method and gender variables.

	abstract = {Background: The reported prevalence of headache disorders in Arab regions varies considerably between countries. This may be due to a lack of standardized survey instruments that capture the prevalence. Purpose of the study: Our goal was to construct and validate a structured headache questionnaire for Arabic-speaking headache patients to be used as an epidemiological survey instrument. Methods: We developed a culturally adapted interviewer-administered questionnaire in Arabic language comprising two sets of questions. The first set included personal and sociodemographic data together with a screening question regarding the presence of headaches over the last year. The second set was designed to define the type and pattern of headaches according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria (for subjects with "yes” answers on the screening question). Validation process took place in two phases through probability random sampling selected from 1,221 headache subjects collected in an epidemiological survey 3 (n=70) and 6 months (n=232) later. A detailed assessment of patients’ headaches was performed by neurologists (blinded from the questionnaire diagnosis) who clinically assessed the patients’ headache. Results: The validity of the questionnaire was tested in 232 subjects with a mean age of 41.2±10.9 years, 72.8% of whom were females. The mean time to complete the questionnaire was 8.4±1.7 minutes. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.903 (95% confidence interval: 0.875-0.925), the Cronbach Κ coefficient was 0.775 (95% confidence interval: 0.682-0.837), and the percentage of agreement was 84.5%. Conclusion: Our results support the use of this comprehensive questionnaire as a valid tool for headache assessment among Arabic-speaking patients. © 2017 El-Sherbiny et al.},

	abstract = {Reading skills is one of the most important language skills. The Success in learning a second language depends on this skill. But it is noted that the final semester students of the Arabic language and literature department who are ready to be graduated and even many graduates of this field are not able to read the Arabic texts correctly and fluently. Therefore, the authors of the present study intend to use the descriptive-analytical method and survey method to evaluate the reading skill of Arabic of undergraduate students to identify their weaknesses on reading and offer some suggestions for developing them. It should be noted that different studies have been conducted on reading skill in Iran and Arabic countries, but none of these studies investigate the weaknesses of Arabic language and literature students of Iran state universities in reading skill. So the present study is completely different from previous studies. The main question of the study is: How weak are Arabic language and literature students in reading skill and what are the reasons of these weaknesses? The statistical sample of the present study has been formed by124 undergraduate students in the Arabic language and literature department in 12 Iranian state universities, 41 of them are male and 83 are female. The tool used in the study is a researcher-made test, which has been designed for the first time for reading skill in Arabic language and literature and the existing models in the Arabic countries have been used to design the test. The results reflected the weakness of students and their lack of mastery in this skill. Although the students who are ready to be graduated, faces weakness in all levels of reading. There is a kind of consensus amongst the experts of Arabic language on this issue. The most important reason of this problem is that there is no special lesson for reading skill in the syllabus. © 2018, Tarbiat Modares University. All rights reserved.},

Therefore, the present study intended to uncover the factors that significantly predict the intention to use mobile learning for learning Arabic to non-native speakers in Saudi Universities. Relevant model was developed by extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) as well as incorporating three other factors namely; language interactivity (LI), system enjoyment (SE) as well as content quality. Quantitative method based on cross-sectional survey design was employed for data collection from 460 students of teaching Arabic to non-native speakers’ programs in Saudi Universities. The tool used for analysis in this study was a Partial Least Squares (PLS) which was used to test the model empirically. It was found from the study that language interactivity (LI), system enjoyment (SE), performance expectancy (PE), facilitating conditions (FC), and expected effort (EE) are significant in relation (either directly or indirectly) to behavioural intention (BI) to use m-learning. The implication for future research development as well as the limitations of the findings are also discussed the paper. © 2019, Universidad del Zulia. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Context. The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) is the most widely used measure of pain-specific catastrophizing. Objectives. The purpose of the present study was to develop and psychometrically evaluate an Arabic-language version of the PCS. Methods. In Study 1, 150 adult chronic nonmalignant pain patients seeking treatment at a hospital setting completed the PCS-A and a number of self-report measures assessing clinical parameters of pain, symptoms of depression, and quality of life. Study 2 employed a cold pressor pain task to examine the PCS-A in a sample of 44 healthy university students. Results. Exploratory factor analyses suggested a two-factor structure. Confirmatory factor analysis comparing the 2-factor model, Sullivan's original 3-factor model, and a 1-factor model based on the total score all provided adequate fit to the data. Cronbach's alpha coefficients across all models met or exceeded accepted standards of reliability. Catastrophizing was associated with higher levels of depression and increased pain intensity and interference. Catastrophizing predicted decreased quality of life, even after controlling for the contribution of gender, employment, depression, and pain interference. PCS-A scores were positively correlated with heightened experimental pain severity and decreased pain tolerance. Conclusion. The present results provide strong support for the psychometric properties of the PCS-A. Copyright © 2017 Huda Abu-Saad Huijer et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Written Medicine Information (WMI) is one of the sources that patients use to obtain information concerning medicine. This paper aims to assess the readability of two types of WMIs in Arabic language based on vocabulary use and sentence structure using a panel of experts and consumers. Methods: This is a descriptive study. Two different types of materials, including the online text from King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Arabic Health Encyclopaedia (KAAHE) and medication leaflets submitted by the manufacturers to the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) were evaluated. We selected a group of sentences from each WMI. The readability was assessed by experts (n = 5) and consumers (n = 5). The sentence readability of each measured using a specific criteria and rated as 1 = easy, 2 = intermediate, or 3 = difficult. Results: A total of 4476 sentences (SFDA 2231; KAHEE 2245) extracted from websites or patient information leaflets on 50 medications and evaluated. The majority of the vocabulary and sentence structure was considered easy by both expert (SFDA: 68%; KAAHE: 76%) and consumer (SFDA: 76%; KAAHE: 84%) groups. The sentences with difficult or intermediate vocabulary and sentence structure are derived primarily from the precautions and side effects sections. Conclusions: The SFDA and KAAHE WMIs are easy to read and understand as judged by our study sample. However; there is room for improvement, especially in sections related to the side effects and precautions. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Study Design. Translation, cross-cultural adaptation, and psychometric testing. Objective. To translate the Back Beliefs Questionnaire (BBQ) into Arabic and investigate its psychometric properties in an Arabic-speaking sample of individuals with low back pain (LBP). Summary of Background Data. Back pain beliefs are associated with pain chronicity and disability in people with LBP. The BBQ is a recognized and frequently used tool for measuring these beliefs. To date the BBQ has not been translated into Arabic. Methods. The English version of the BBQ was translated and culturally adapted into Arabic (BBQ-Ar) according to published guidelines. The BBQ-Ar was then tested in a sample of 115 Arabic-speaking individuals with LBP. Reliability was evaluated through internal consistency (Cronbach α) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient), the latter in a subgroup of 25. Construct validity was assessed using exploratory factor analysis and by examining the correlation between the BBQ-Ar, the Oswestry Disability Index and a Numerical Pain Rating Scale. Results. Internal consistency of the BBQ-Ar was good (Cronbach α=0.77). Test-retest reliability was good (intraclass correlation coefficient [2,1]=0.88). Exploratory factor analysis revealed a three-factor structure, explaining 46% of total variance, with the first factor alone explaining 24%. Eight of the nine scoring items were loaded on the first factor thus forming a unidimensional scale. A significant negative correlation was found between Oswestry Disability Index and BBQ-Ar scores (r=-0.307; P<0.01), whereas no significant correlation was found between BBQ-Ar and Pain Rating Scale scores. No floor or celling effects were observed. Conclusion. The BBQ-Ar is a valid and reliable tool that can be used to assess back pain beliefs in Arabic-speaking individuals. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.},

	abstract = {Syntax plays a key role in natural language processing, but it does not always occupy an important position in applications. The main objective of this article is to solve the problem of the grammatical case ending errors produced by Arabic learners or certain common errors. Arabic can be considered more complex than English or French. He does not have vowels; diacritic signs (vowels) are placed above or below the letters. These diacritic signs are abandoned in most Arabic texts. This induces both grammatical and lexical ambiguities in Arabic. The present paper describes an automatic correction of this type of errors using "Stanford Parser" with an ontology containing the rules of the Arabic language. We segment the text into sentences, then we extract the annotations of each word with the syntactic relations coming from our parser, then we treat the relations obtained with our ontology. Finally, we compare the original sentence with the corrected one in order to detect the error. The implemented system achieved a total detection of about 94%. It is concluded that the approach is clearly promising by observing the results as compared to the limited number of available Arabic grammar checkers. © 2019, Science and Information Organization.},

Arabic-speaking communities in Australia underutilise mental health services despite high levels of trauma and psychological distress. Clinicians who work with this population lack linguistically and culturally appropriate clinical resources. The aim of this study was to explore the acceptability and clinical utility of a Mindfulness Skills CD translated into formal Arabic. The 70 participants were Arabic-speaking adults, mostly Lebanese-born Muslim women, who enrolled in a 5-week mindfulness program using the CD and agreed to follow-up at 12 weeks. Both recruitment and data collection were undertaken by a female project officer who is a widely respected member of the Arabic community in south-east Sydney. Compliance with the program protocol was high and all but 4 participants continued to use the CD beyond the 5 weeks. Overall, participants reported that mindfulness techniques fitted well with their way of life and were compatible with their cultural and religious practices. Most found mindfulness complementary to their regular reflective prayer. Using the Mindfulness Skills CD was associated with statistically significant reductions in psychological distress as measured by the Kessler Scale (K10) and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS21) postprogram (K10; DASS21 Depression and Stress subscales) and at follow-up (all measures). The evaluation showed that the Arabic Mindfulness Skills CD is an effective and culturally appropriate mental health resource for this population group. This low-cost, easily distributed resource is suitable for use in individual self-management and as an adjunct to primary and specialist mental health care. © The Author(s) 2019.},

	abstract = {Background: Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplant (FACT-BMT) has been translated from English into several languages. Currently, there is no validated translation of FACT-BMT in Arabic. Here, we are reporting the first Arabic translation and validation of the FACT-BMT. Methods: The study was approved by the Institutional Research Advisory Council. The Arabic translation followed the standard Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT.org) translation methodology (with permission). Arabic FACT-BMT (50- items) was statistically validated. Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency, Spearman's rank correlation coefficients method for Inter-scale correlations and Principal Component Analysis for factorial construct validity was used. Results: One hundred and eight consecutive relapsed /refractory lymphoma patients who underwent high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant were enrolled. There were 68 males (63%) and 40 females (37%) with a median age of 29 years (range 14-62). After Arabic questionnaire pre-testing (Cronbach's alpha 0.744), the study included 108 patients. Cronbach's alpha for the entire FACT-BMT indicated an excellent internal consistency (0.90); range (0.67 to 0.91). Cronbach's alpha for sub-groups of social (0.78), emotional (0.67) and functional wellbeing was (0.88). Cronbach's alpha for bone marrow transplant (0.81), FACT-General (0.89), and FACT- Trial Outcome Index (TOI); (0.91) also revealed excellent internal consistency. Patients had high scores in all domains of quality of life, indicating that most patients were leading a normal life. This translation of FACT-BMT in Arabic was reviewed and approved for submission by the FACIT.org. Conclusions: Our data reports the first translated, validated and approved Arabic version of FACT-BMT. This will help large numbers of Arabic speaking patients undergoing stem cell/bone marrow transplantation, across the globe. © 2018 The Author(s).},

Data were collected through a questionnaire and interviews. The findings reveal that students tend to adopt a holistic view of the learning task and relate it to real-life, personal experience. Participants selected interaction with the teacher, speaking, and flashcards as their most preferred application-directed learning strategies. These selections demonstrate that Arabic students desire to be proactive in order to make the language more concrete for them, to enhance their performance, and to develop language skills that will last a lifetime. Whereas advanced level participants preferred interaction with the teacher, speaking, flashcards, and working individually, beginner level participants preferred learning grammar and group work. The empirical evidence from this study could have implications regarding theoretical models of effective Arabic language instruction, Arabic teacher education programs, and curriculum development. © 2019, Adam Mickiewicz University Press.

Active Communicative Method (KAK) is one method that can help students master the Arabic speech. This study aims to find out how is the implementation of the KAK at Pondok Pesantren Wali Songo. It also aims to look at the problems encountered in the implementation of the KAK, KAK effect in mastering Arabic speech and designing learning methods that can be used as an alternative in learning Arabic. Methodology: This study is a qualitative case study through interviews, observations and document analysis involving 12 respondents. Results: The findings showed that the implementation process KAK there are two, namely in the classroom and outside the classroom through a variety of activities such as the addition of vocabulary and sentence, question and answer, problem-solving, etc., and involve various stakeholders such as students, peers, muharrikah al-Lughah, teacher and principals. The weakness of Arabic grammar (Nahwu & Sharaf) is one of the problems faced by the students and they also forgot to speak the Arabic language. Shame and fear of making mistakes are also a problem in the implementation of KAK. The findings also indicate that the use of KAK had a positive impact on learning the Arabic language, especially speech, adding vocabulary, sentences, and improve understanding of the scriptures in Arabic. Implications/Applications: This researcher proposed a framework of Arabic KAK based learning that can be used as an alternative to diversify methods of learning foreign languages either in Indonesia or Malaysia. © Marpuah and Sulton.},

	abstract = {Purpose of the study: The objective of the study was to analyze the perceptions of tahfiz students in understanding the meaning of the verses and their knowledge of the Arabic language syntax and morphology in memorizing the Qur’an. Design/methodology/approach: For this article, the study sample is comprised of 30 tahfiz students at the Azhar Institute of Qiraat in Shobra, Cairo, Egypt. They were chosen as a minimum sample of 30 population tahfiz students who had followed an Arabic Course in Malaysia. The survey method uses a Likert scale-based questionnaire which measures the levels of understanding among tahfiz students, which includes the overall mastery of Qur’anic understanding and the structure of the Arabic language’s syntax and morphology. The data were then analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics to identify the mean values of each item. Findings: The results of this study reveal that the level of understanding of Arabic grammar and morphology of the Qur’an amongst tahfiz students is high. Research Implications: This study recommends to explore the possibility of establishing a curriculum framework that gives provision for the Arabic language to be mastered by students in tahfiz institutions. Once this curriculum is implemented, the tasks of Qur’anic educators will be made easier. Social Implications: The study throws light on the integrated approach in memorizing the Qur'an will produce tahfiz students who are able to master the memorization effectively. Originality/Value: Only a very few have examined the proficiency of the Arabic language and its function to the ḥuffaz in memorizing the Qur'an effectively. Most of the issues often faced by ḥuffaz who are non-native Arabic speakers are closely related to their mastery, or lack thereof, of the Arabic language. Since memorizing the Qur’an involves proper understanding of the purpose and structure of the language, there is a need to carry out a study concerning the same. © Usman et al.},

This study examines the theatrical play Junun by the Tunisian playwright Jalila Baccar, written and played in Tunisian Arabic in 2001 and self-translated into French in 2003. At first, the functions of the different languages in the Arabic text have been analysed. These can stem from a realistic motivation (representing Tunisian reality), from a compositional motivation (constructing the literary work's fictional world), or from an esthetic motivation (through intertextual references to other works). Subsequently, the translation strategies of the heteroglossia from the first text to the French version have been studied. Finally, this textual approach has been framed within the analysis of the relationship between context and the history of heteroglossia, in order to broaden the scope of potential extensions of this research. © 2016 Languages Cultures Mediation.All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Nowadays, there is a high demand for online services and applications. However, there is a challenge to keep these applications secured by applying different methods rather than using the traditional approaches such as passwords and usernames. Keystroke dynamics is one of the alternative authentication methods that provide high level of security in which the used keyboard plays an important role in the recognition accuracy. To guarantee the robustness of a system in different practical situations, there is a need to examine how much the performance of the system is affected by changing the keyboard layout. This paper aims to investigate the impact of using different keyboards on the recognition accuracy for Arabic free-text typing. Design/methodology/approach: To evaluate how much the performance of the system is affected by changing the keyboard layout, an experimental study is conducted by using two different keyboards which are a Mac’s keyboard and an HP’s keyboard. Findings: By using the Mac’s keyboard, the results showed that the false rejection rate (FRR) was 0.20, whilst the false acceptance rate (FAR) was 0.44. However, these values have changed when using the HP’s keyboard where the FRR was equal to 0.08 and the FAR was equal to 0.60. Research limitations/implications: The number of participants in the experiment, as the authors were targeting much more participants.

	abstract = {Objective. To assess student communication and patient management skill with introduction of Arabic and use of simulated patient assessments to a communication and counseling course. Design. Five, 3-hour tutorials (clinical skill laboratory) were added to the course covering: listening and empathic responding, non-verbal communications, interviewing skills, assertiveness, counseling in special situations: conflict, anger, worry or rushed situations, and professional decision making. Arabic content was introduced to the course to enhance Arabic communications and competence among students. Simulated patient assessment was used to evaluate student skills. Students’ feedback about course changes was evaluated. Assessment. The course now covers a wider content and Arabic language. Students’ scores were similar in the assessment and other assessments within the course and between Arabic and English groups. Students favorably rated the changes in the course and provided constructive feedback on content usefulness and adequacy. Conclusion. Expanding the course to include Arabic language and content and simulated patient assessments enhanced student communication skills. © 2017, American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy.

The effectiveness of binary mask thresholding function based coiflet5 mother wavelet transform is compared with Wiener method, spectral subtraction, log-MMSE, test-PSC and p-mmse in presence of babble, pink, white, f-16 and Volvo car interior noise. The noisy input speech signals are processed at various levels of input SNR range from −5 to −25 dB. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated with the help of PESQ, SNR and cepstral distance measure. The results obtained by proposed binary mask thresholding function based coiflet5 wavelet transform method are very encouraging and shows that the proposed method is much helpful in Arabic speech enhancement than other existing methods. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Recently, Deep Learning models have been extensively used for many Natural Language Processing tasks including Sentiment Analysis. In this paper, the authors propose a Deep Learning model for Arabic language sentence-level Sentiment Analysis. The proposed model represents an integration between an emerged variant of Recurrent Neural Networks known as Simple Recurrent Unit which is characterized by its light recurrent computations, and an attention mechanism that concentrates more on the important parts of an input text. The Simple Recurrent Unit model allows parallel recurrent calculations that lead to enhance the training process in terms of time and accuracy. Experiments were performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed model using the Large Scale Arabic Book Reviews (LABR) dataset. The proposed model obtained state of the art results compared to other Deep Learning models where it achieved 94.53% in terms of accuracy measure with faster execution time. © 2019 IEEE.},

There are several intervening approaches that are based on features contained in an acoustic signal and on natural language processing techniques. However, up to our knowledge, these studies are not extended to detect phonemes that pose degraded speeches. In this paper, we propose a new method to detect mispronounced sounds. We are based on a phonetic-probabilistic modeling. The invented study accounts four fundamental tasks. The first task summarizes the calculation of the probabilistic-phonetic model referring to Arabic speech. The second one is dedicated to calculate the probabilistic-phonetic model appropriate to a speaker whose elocution is classified as pathological. Thirdly, we compare between the two previous models to distinguish two main classes: the input speech can be healthy or pathological. The fourth stage consists in introducing an original algorithm based on a phonetic modeling to generate problematic sounds and to evaluate the elocution of each speaker having voice pathologies by attributing them a language level. This task will be only applied if the input speech is pathological. The obtained results are satisfactory. We have attained a problematic-sound identification rate of 96%. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

The rubric consisted of six aspects with a four-point rating scale and was originally written in English and aimed to be used by the English language learners. As the respondents of this research were the Indonesian students who learn Arabic language as a foreign language, the rubric was therefore modified and translated into Indonesian language. Rasch measurement model approach provides various analyses with empirical evidence about the quality of instrument by looking at the rating scale analysis, summary statistics, item fit, principal component analysis and Wright map. About 43 Arabic language learners from a university in Salatiga, Indonesia, were involved in this study. The finding showed that the four rating options were clearly understood by the respondents. All six items in the rubric were also appropriately measure students’ speaking skills. High value of person (0.84) and item reliability (0.94) indicated good quality of both respondents and instrument. The Cronbach alpha value 0.83 indicated high reliability. To sum up, the self-assessment speaking rubric has a good quality to measure speaking skills and is appropriate to be used by students to self-assess their Arabic speaking ability. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to evaluate the students’ motivation levels towards learning Arabic language vocabulary among Arabic language graduate students in public universities. The motivational domains that had been analysed in this study were holistic, intrinsic and extrinsic. A total of 344 Arabic language graduate students had been used as respondents in this study. This study is a cross-sectional study involving final year Arabic language students from eight public universities. Futhermore, simple random sampling was used as a sampling method based on the ability of the researcher to obtain the sampling frame. The data was analysed using IBM SPSS version 19.0 descriptively such as mean, standard deviation and percentage. The findings showed that the motivation Arabic language graduate students to learn the Arabic vocabulary for holistic motivation was at a high level followed by extrinsic and intrinsic domains at a moderate level. Therefore, this study revealed the differences in findings that religious or holistic factor was a main factor of Muslim students to continue studying Arabic language vocabulary. However, research in western findings showed that rewards, recognition and external returns were the factors to learn the vocabulary of language. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2019.},

	abstract = {Background: Burnout is an inappropriate response to chronic work stress, leading to emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (D), and low personal accomplishment (PA). Burnout can affect workers in the helping professions. To quantitatively assess the burnout level among teachers, Maslach has adapted the "Maslach Burnout Inventory" (MBI) to the educational environment (the so-called MBI Educators Survey version or MBI-ES). Among teachers, sports and physical education teachers may suffer from burnout due to high workload. Aims: No reliable psychometric tool in Arabic language exists that can be used to measure the burnout level among sports and physical education teachers. The objective of the present study was to develop a burnout measurement scale according to the Maslach's three-dimensional theoretical model for physical education teachers in Tunisia and to test its factor structure, in terms of internal consistency/reliability, predictive validity, and sensitivity. Methods: A total of 525 Tunisian teachers teaching in secondary schools from different Tunisian governorates volunteered to participate in this study. The sample comprised of 285 males (54.3%) and of 240 females (45.7%). More in detail, 327 were teachers of primary school of physical education (62.3%) and 198 teachers of secondary school (37.7%). Teachers were administered both the ad hoc developed "Teacher of Physical Education Burnout Inventory" (TPEBI) and the MBI-ES. Both exploratory [principal component analysis (PCA)] and confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were performed. Results: The Cronbach's alpha coefficients were excellent (0.93, 0.94, and 0.91 for EE, D, and PA, respectively). The correlation matrix indicated significant correlations between the TPEBI and MBI-ED dimensions. However, CFA fit indices were not completely satisfactory. Conclusion: Given the good PCA factor loadings, the correlation matrix, the sensitivity analysis, and the excellent internal consistency, it can be concluded that the TPEBI is a reliable psychometric tool that can be used to quantitatively assess the burnout level among teachers of physical education in the Arabic-speaking world. However, considering the CFA fit indices, further modifications to fully support the model are warranted. © 2019 Chalghaf, Guelmami, Slimani, Del Puente, Re, Zerbetto, Maldonado Briegas, Guglielmi, Garbarino, Azaiez and Bragazzi.},

However, according to prior reviews, they are not being employed widely in educational institutions, as they ought to be, as long as they represent technical challenges that still need to be taken up. The aim of this work is to demonstrate some of the possibilities that Text To Speech offers for language learners with a particular focus on Arabic language. For this purpose a web-based assistive platform based on a Text To Speech API was developed and used during a self-directed dictation exercise. It enables the users to have their text read out loud as they write. This aural feedback will enable them to auto detect their mistakes, make the perceived corrections and re-listen again. The study was conducted on a sample of 30 pupils of both sexes of third, fourth and fifth grades. Overall, the tests revealed a significant improvement on their writing skills; the participants were able to locate and correct a high percentage of their mistakes under speech synthesis vocalization. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the global spread of thermal comfort studies, thermal scales are translated into different languages to adapt local context in which the studies are applied. However, translating thermal comfort scales does not maintain behaviour that is associated with their original English versions. Behaviour differences include irregular categories’ width, asymmetry, and deviation of the middle category centre from the centre of the thermal continuum. These differences have a negative influence on the results of thermal comfort studies and their accuracy. Applying the successive categories method, this paper explores the change in ASHRAE, Bedford, and Nicol scales’ behaviour when translated into the Arabic language. The translated scales were integrated into questionnaires distributed among female high school students in Muscat, the capital city of Oman, as part of a larger survey that lasted for a whole year. The findings revealed the deviation of the translated scales from the original assumptions of the English versions. This included categories’ irregular widths and asymmetry in addition to the deviation of the centre of the middle categories from the centre of the thermal continuum. Besides, it was found that both ASHRAE and Bedford scales covered different ranges on the thermal continuum, which questions their assumed equivalence. Based on these findings, the accuracy of the thermal comfort analysis is negatively affected. Considering the sensitivity of scales’ behaviour to the used phrases, further explorations implementing the terms examined in this study are recommended. © 2019},

	abstract = {The Vector Space Model (VSM) is a common document representation model that is widely used in data mining and information retrieval (IR) systems. However, this technique poses some challenges such as high dimensional space and semantic loss representation. Therefore, the latent semantic indexing (LSI) is proposed to reduce the feature dimensions and to generate semantic rich features that represent conceptual term-document associations. In particular, LSI has been successfully implemented in search engines and text classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance the quality of the retrieved documents in search engines for Arabic language. That is, we propose to use a new extension of the LSI technique instead of just using the standard LSI technique. The LSI method proposed is based on employing the word co-occurrences to form a term-by-document matrix. The proposed method is to be based on the documents evaluating cosine similarity measures for term-by-document matrix. We will empirically evaluate the performance using an Arabic data collection that contains no less than 500 documents with no less than 30,000 unique words. A testing set contains keywords from a specific domain will be used to evaluate the quality of the top 20-30 retrieved documents using different singular values (i.e. different number of dimensions). The results will be judged on the performance of the proposed method as it is compared to the standard LSI. © 2018 IEEE.},

Due to this revolution, most researches are now focusing on extracting meaningful information from social media to better understand the user's attitude. Sentiment analysis and opinion mining are fields of text mining that focus on extracting and analyzing the emotions and opinions of the users with respect to specific topic. Many approaches are proposed to extract opinions and classify them based on its polarities as positive, negative or neutral. Most works on sentiment analysis are done over English language, but a few of them focused on Arabic language.

Some e-book formats can be read through different reader devices such as computers, laptops, tablets and smart phones by using special e-book reader software. Secondary level textbook e-books in Khartoum are prepared into PDF format. The PDF format is extremely difficult to read on small devices. This is because PDF format aims to keep the format and size of the PDF document identical on all devices. This requires a user of a small mobile device to scroll horizontally as well as vertically on the device. EPUB format, on the other hand, allows the user to configure features such as font size, screen size, etc, thereby making it easier to read the document on a small mobile device. This research specifically looked at using EPUB format documents in an Arabic speaking classroom with Arabic language textbooks. The use of EPUB allowed pupils to load the textbook onto their own small personal mobile devices.

This study aimed to trans-culturally adapt and validate the Pepe’s “Teacher Job Satisfaction Scale” 9 items (TJSS-9), creating the “Teacher of Physical Education Job Satisfaction Inventory” (TPEJSI) in Arabic language. This scale was administered to a Tunisian population of sports and physical education teachers and analyzed according to the Pepe's theoretical model. More in detail, this investigation systematically tested its factor structure, in terms of internal consistency/reliability, predictive validity, sensitivity and convergent validity. Methods: A total of 417 Tunisian teachers of sports and physical education participated voluntarily in this study. The sample comprised of 258 males and of 159 females. More in detail, 189 were teachers teaching in primary schools of physical education, 105 teaching in secondary schools, and 123 were university teachers. Both exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory (CFA) factor analyses were performed on random-split halves of the sample. Results: The three-dimensional alpha coef?cients of the TPEJSI were all > 0.80: for satisfaction with colleagues, alpha was 0.865; for satisfaction with parents, alpha was 0.856 and for satisfaction with students alpha was 0.860. The CFA fit indices were satisfactory. Conclusions: Given the good EFA factor loadings, the CFA fit indices, the correlation matrix, the sensitivity analysis, the convergent validity and the excellent internal consistency, it can be concluded that the TPEJSI is a good psychometric tool that can be used to quantitatively assess the job satisfaction level among teachers of sports and physical education in the Arabic-speaking world. © 2019  Chalghaf, Guelmami, Re, Maldonado Briegas, Garbarino, Azaiez and Bragazzi.},

Its detection has become a challenge in different natural language processing applications (e.g., plagiarism detection, information retrieval and extraction, question answering, etc.). Different from western languages like English, few works have been addressed the problem of extrinsic paraphrase detection in Arabic language. In this context, we proposed a deep learning-based approach to indicate how original and suspect documents expressed the same meaning. Indeed, word2vec algorithm extracted the relevant features by predicting each word to its neighbors. Subsequently, averaging the obtained vectors was efficient for generating sentence vectors representations. Then, convolutional neural network was useful to capture more contextual information and compute the degree of semantic relatedness. Faced to the lack of resources publicly available, paraphrased corpus was developed using skip gram model. It had better performance in replacing an original word by its most similar one that had the same grammatical class from a vocabulary. Finally, the proposed system achieved good results enhancing an efficient contextual relationship detection between Arabic documents in terms of precision (85%) and recall (86.8%) than previous studies. © 2019, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.},

	abstract = {Recent numbers put the Arabic language at around 250 million native speakers, making it the fifth spoken language regarding the number of speakers. Therefore, it has gained the interest of researchers in speech technologies in particular speech recognition and speech synthesis. Indeed, many researchers are still investigating in Arabic Text To Speech to deliver an intelligible and close to natural Text To Speech systems. Nevertheless, the most of the available free and semi-free Arabic Text To Speech systems are still away from the natural sounding as human voice does, and the generation of smooth voice is still involved. The primary intention of this work is to increase the quality of the produced speech resulting from the sub-segment based approach proposed in our previous work. To this end, a lemma-based approach for concatenative TTS synthesis is adopted and presented in this paper. In this context, a study of Arabic lemmas frequency was conducted to identify the highly frequent lemmas that often occur in written and spoken Classical and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). This study reports an analysis of roughly 65 million words fully vocalized obtained from Tashkila corpus, Nemlar, and Al Jazeera. These latter cover modern and classical Arabic languages. As a result, an Arabic lemmatized frequency list was generated. The top 1,000 frequent lemmas were found to provide approximately 79% coverage of the Arabic words. Thus, the former were used as the basic acoustic units of our Text to Speech System. Finally, we demonstrate that this approach affords an improvement in the intelligibility and naturalness of a Text To Speech system with an overall rate 4.5 out of 5. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

The data consists of 14 speakers with 1, 443 utterances which are complete sentences. 15 emotions investigated with five that are dominants: enthusiasm, admiration, disapproval, neutral, and joy. The emotion corpus serves in classification experiments using a variety of acoustic features extracted by openSMILE. Some algorithms of classification are implemented with the WEKA toolkit. Low-level audio features and the corresponding delta features are utilized. Statistical functionals are applied to each of the features and delta features. The best classification results - measured by a weighted average of f-measure - is 0.48 for the five emotions. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

To examine these factors, the manual method of analysis was adopted. The findings revealed that the bias in favor of males is still prevalent, as the phenomenon of males-first—referring to the secondary status of women—is evident in the textbook examined.

The Arabic language has completely different characteristics to those of English. The approach followed in this study involves the use of the keyboard's key-layout. The method extracts timing features from specific key-pairs in the typed text. Decision trees were exploited to classify each of the users' data. In parallel for comparison, support vector machines were also used for classification in association with an ant colony optimisation feature selection technique. The results obtained from this study are encouraging as low false accept rates and false reject rates were achieved in the experimentation phase. This signifies that satisfactory overall system performance was achieved by using the typing attributes in the proposed approach, while typing Arabic text. © 2016, Institution of Engineering and Technology.

This program is established based on the complete awareness of the language contents and its four levels of language study (phonological, morphological, syntactical and semantic) with distinct focus on prominent foundations and theories concerned with academic accomplishment as derived from the e-learning data system. The research is established on textual and phonological database involving vocabulary comprehension and its manners of pronunciation and inferring to the most highly expected errors from the non-native speakers of Arabic. More than 120 users participated in the process, under the supervision of a specialized teamwork between the administrative, linguistic, educational and engineering departments. The tentative results statistically reflect the program's efficiency and its distinctive role in prompting the academic process and the increase in the cognitive outcome among the students who are assigned as the experimental sample group in comparison to the results of the realizable control sample from similar conventional education. This program garners practical and academic features ensuring more worth in studying it compared to other e-learning programs. In essence, Virtual Tutor does not only embody theoretical foundations which are supported with modern methodological designs, but it also simultaneously ensures efficient participatory role of the users.},

Given the importance of managing a unified dictionary and considering the personalized needs of users, we propose an approach for generating personalized views starting from a normalized dictionary with respect to Lexical Markup Framework LMF-ISO 24613 norm This approach provides the re-use of already defined views for a community of users by managing their profiles information and promoting the materialization of the generated views. It is composed of four main steps: (i) the projection of data categories controlled by a set of constraints (related to the user's profiles), (ii) the selection of values with consistency checking, (iii) the automatic generation of the query's model and finally, (iv) the refinement of the view. The proposed approach was consolidated by carrying out an experiment on an LMF normalized Arabic dictionary. © 2010 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

A case study involving a Dubai Municipality website has been used to identify the differences between the two languages. A usability test was developed which was divided into two parts: a usability experiment and an online questionnaire. A total of 30 evaluators were chosen for the test. T-tests were conducted for each of the 10 tasks performed during the experiment. The evaluator questionnaire was used after the experiment to obtain the evaluators' feedback. In terms of design, websites in Arabic and English have the same look and feel. In terms of information content, the English content was more usable than Arabic. The research concluded with recommendations to improve the content of the Arabic website. Copyright © 2014, IGI Global.},

The sample consisted of 123 male and female pupils from IRBED Education Directorate, Jordan. The pupils were randomly assigned to any one of the two modes. The independent variable comprised the two modes of the instructional software, the students' achievement levels in the Arabic Language class and gender. The dependent variable was the achievements of the pupils in the Arabic Language test. The theoretical framework of this study was based on Mayer's Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning. Four hypotheses were postulated and tested. Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) showed that pupils using the (AI) mode performed significantly better than those using (TI) mode.

The arrival of Islam in Terengganu also introduced a new language, namely the Arabic language, to the Terengganu society. In relation to that, this study was conducted to analyse the use of the Arabic language in Terengganu in early 20th century. Apart from that, it was also aimed at looking into categories of the words used. This study is a qualitative study using literature search and document analysis to obtain data. Several letters, still in the handwritten/manuscript form, were made samples of this study. These letters, written by the general public, religious scholars and royals, were descriptively analysed. The study found that the society in Terengganu then knew and used the language in their writing. Arabic words which were used by the Terengganu Malay society at that time are divided into three categories, namely words which were known by the general public and well assimilated into the Malay language; words which were known and used by only the Islamic scholars and the educated mass; and finally words which are still in their original forms which have yet to go through assimilation process. © 2014 Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

However, it may be rarely known about the early education histoiy of Imam Shafie that focused on learning Arabic language and literature. Hence, with the application of qualitative approach and historical design analysis on the background and histoiy of his life, this study makes an attempt to explain the early experience and learning of Imam Shafie in Arabic language and literature. This study also tries to see how he was recognized as the figure of Arabic language and literature of his time, apart from the figures in the school of Islamic Law and Jurisprudence. The outcome of the analysis found that Imam Shafie received an early exposure in Arabic language education and literature during his childhood until teenager and he was chosen as a transcendent figure of Arabic language and literature at his early teens. © Medwell Journals, 2016.},

The syntactic structure of sentence parts may be missing, taking into accounts different orders of words and phrases. This paper aims to develop and assess an Arabic Lexicon. The new automatic Lexicon was developed with the purpose of analyzing and extracting the attributes of Arabic words. The lexicon was implemented using two-step process, tokenization and part of speech tagging. The output of the lexicon can be processed by another parser tool which perform an analysis on Arabic sentence to determines if the sentence follows a valid grammatical structure. An evaluation test was conducted to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the new lexicon design using real sentences taken randomly. The results have shown a minimum accuracy rate of 92% which is considered highly satisfactory. The newly designed lexicon can be widely used for any application that requires Arabic Language analysis and processing.},

For quantitative data, stratified random sampling technique was used involving 455 students and 48 course lecturers while for qualitative data, 13 interviews with students, 8 interviews with subject lecturers and 12 classroom observations wereengaged. The study found that the textbooks were the only learning material that had been highly used compared to other materials, showing that learning was primarily based on the textbooks. This study suggests some improvements in the use of learning materials such as to use authentic materials through computer and Internet. The textbooks have to be used as a guide and not as a final objective of learning. The use of learning materials has to support students' interest, their needs and motivation.

Some of the hindrances of learning Arabic language are refered to the content order of the school books. Especially teaching Arabic high language in grade one seems to be a difficult job for some reasons such as the students' enterance to a new stage. If the different components of the books' content get realized and catagorized, the understanding and explication would be easier. Thus analizing the content of Arabic high school book in grade one can be an important step towards identification of its weaknesses. This article aims to evaluate the Arabaic high school book in grade one on the basis of content analysis patterns and arrangement criteria relying on Content Analysis Approach, which is a resaerch method for objective, quantitative and organized discription of superficial contents in communications. The research was descriptive-analytic. The results showed that considering These patterns and criteria, this school book has been highly successful in accurately performing the principles of edunation planning and content arrangement. © 2014, Tarbiat Modares University.

Furthermore, it is a known fact that the content of speech can be revealed partially through lip-reading. Human speech perception is bimodal in nature: Humans combine audio and visual information in deciding what has been spoken, especially in noisy environments. In this paper, we describe a speaker identification system where lip information is fused with corresponding speech information from each speaker. The energy, the zero cross ratio (ZCR) and the pitch are used as features for the audio modality. The features for the lip texture modality are 2D-DCT coefficients of the luminance component. Intuitively, we would expect lip information to be somewhat complementary to speech information due to the range of lip movements associated with the production of the corresponding phonemes in speech using a multilayer perceptron classifier. © 2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Spoken Language detection is the process of either accepting or rejecting a language identity from its sample speech. The process is essential as it represents the first phase for a complete multilingual-enabled speech processing applications. However, most efforts are focused on European languages and the research is relatively few for other languages such as Arabic. This is mainly due to the lack of tools and resources, e.g., Arabic speech corpora. Furthermore, the majority of the proposed approaches for Arabic detection are language-dependent rather than independent ones, in which the model uses only acoustic properties of speech signal. This paper describes an ongoing research to develop a language independent Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) detector, which is a binary Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier that is based on speech acoustic features. In that context, the classifier is used to classify speech utterance into either classA, which represents the Arabic language or classNA to denote non-Arabic languages. As most currently available speech corpora are license restricted and their languages are selected based on population or geographical distribution, a new multilingual speech corpus with six languages is being created. Languages in this created corpus have some sort of similarity with MSA, e.g., Arabic and Hebrew. This property adds another dimension of complexity to the classification task, but it is essential as one of the major goal of this research is to measure whether the efficiency of the MSA model will be preserved on the same level when tested with other languages that have some sort of relationship with the MSA or other Arabic dialect. This will be referred to in this paper as stability-against-similarity of the model. © 2013 IEEE.},

This paper, reports on the survey of the support for the Arabic language in some of the existing semantic web technologies and gives future scenario in applying Semantic Web for Arabic applications. Finally, we propose a new framework intended to add a semantic web layer to the current web based application in order to improve the process of linking, integrating, and searching for different types of applications.

A total of 180 participants responded to 104 items on attitude towards the course, teaching techniques, teaching and learning processes, textbook as well as reading sub-skills. The students also responded to an open-ended section that sought their views and suggestions about the course. It was found that the students' perception of the course was largely positive but they opined that a communication-based syllabus could be more beneficial for employment purposes. These findings are important in determining the future direction of the Arabic language courses for humanities students. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.},

The study utilized survey method where questionnaires were administered to 100 secondary school students who learned Arabic language. Collected data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistic. Findings indicated that most students had a low level of Arabic language competency. Majority of the respondents have limited Arabic language vocabulary. Findings also suggest that Arabic language speaking practice among them is moderate. Many respondents received low socio-educational support in learning Arabic language at a school level. Findings also showed that the weakness in the social support system in learning Arabic language has affected the Arabic language speaking practices. Therefore, the schools are suggested to arrange activities that could encourage the usage of Arabic language among the students. Re-strategizing the current support and practice to improve students' ability in using Arabic language is needed. © Journal of Language and Literature.},

For teachers and laymen alike, cultural competence, i.e., the knowledge of the customs, beliefs, and systems of another country, is indisputably an integral part of Arabic language learning, and many teachers have seen it as their goal to merge the teaching of culture into the Arabic language teaching classes. It could be argued that the notion of communicative competence asserts the role of context and the circumstances under which language can be employed properly and appropriately. In other words, since the wider context of language, that is, society and culture, has been expanded, many teachers and students incessantly talk about it without knowing what its exact meaning is. In fact, what most teachers and students seem to lose is the fact that knowledge of the grammatical system of Arabic language [grammatical competence] has to be complemented by understanding of culture-specific meanings. © by The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Vocabulary is a vital aspect in second language learning. The knowledge and mastery of vocabulary are able to give a direct effect on learning and mastery of a second language. The learning of Arabic language in Malaysia has also put the mastery of Arabic language vocabulary as the main goal. The aim of this survey is to explore the learning strategies of Arabic language vocabulary of pre-university students in Malaysia. The objectives of this study are to (a) measure the vocabulary learning strategies (VLS) usage level of pre university students, (b) to identify the highest strategy usage for each main vocabulary learning strategy (VLS) and (c) to identify the lowest strategy usage for each main vocabulary learning strategy (VLS). Questionnaires are used as the instrument which is developed based on the Schmitt’s VLS classification (1997). The sample involved 742 students in 15 religious high school (SMKA) and government-aided religious school (SABK). The study found that pre-university students have been using vocabulary learning strategies (VLS) moderately. Generally, the students used the determination strategy with the highest frequency compared to other strategies whilst the cognitive strategy is the least optimized one. Six strategies are used regularly while 12 strategies are not used frequently. The findings show that pre-university students tend to use strategies that are simpler, not creative and do not require high level of thinking. This situation somehow has displayed that the learning of Arabic language vocabulary in Malaysia is still very far from achieving the vocabulary learning objectives. © 2015, Canadian Center of Science and Education.

	abstract = {Self-efficacy has long been a focus in language learning. Perceived as one's belief in his or her own capabilities in accomplishing a particular task, it affirms that personal behaviours, thoughts, beliefs and environmental conditions pose great impact on achievement. However, in Arabic language learning, research on self-efficacy is still at its infancy, what more of an instrument which precisely measures self-efficacy in Arabic language learning environment. Hence, this paper aims at verification of a newly-developed instrument, Arabic Language Efficacy Questionnaire (ALEQ), as well as to explore the relationship between self-efficacy and Arabic language achievement. A sample of 234 undergraduate students majoring in Arabic language was exposed to ALEQ, and a set of tests to determine their achievement in reading, writing and grammar. A principal components analysis with varimax rotation yields a 3-factor solution with satisfactory psychometric properties. The Pearson's r correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between efficacy in reading, writing and grammar and students' achievement. Results clearly document that the ALEQ is a multidimensional measurement of Arabic language efficacy. It is concluded that although ALEQ has broad applicability, the scale herein may have relevance to the students' level of confidence in learning Arabic language and may be used in both research and teaching environments.},

	abstract = {Arabic language analyzers have been studied constructed and studied by many researchers. Most of research projects and commercial applications in the area of Arabic Natural Language Processing (ANLP) build their own analyzer. Typically they are intended for just one project or application and can not be generalized to work in other areas of ANLP. All of these analyzers didn't cover our requirements from the analyzer which make us to build a new one. Our analyzer is also a part of a complete Arabic tagging system. It receives the output of a tokenizer in the form of inflected words, and produces for each of them a set of several possible analyzes, consisting of: a POS tag, features and a lemma. It differs from most of the existing analyzers because it produces a lemma rather than stem or root, which is a significantly harder task in Arabic, and because POS and features are described by a new very rich tagset, described in a previous publication. The test dataset was a small corpus of 16 k words, manually annotated by a single analysis for each word, correct for this particular use of that word. In the test, for 99.67% of words, the correct analysis was among those produced by the analyzer. On the other hand, in a manual verification of the output of the analyzer, only 0.1% of all analyses were grammatically incorrect. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Consequently, they develop their software needs assessment in order to assess the information, and allow the learner to correct his knowledge autonomously. The teaching of languages takes place in the context of distance education and involves several research areas, as automatic processing of natural language and modeling of learning action in distance education environment. Therefore, the development of a remote Evaluation system for Arabic requires the preparation of various linguistic tools such as analyzers In this paper we focus on the development of a Morphological Analyzer In Arabic Language which can be operated in a remote evaluation system of the Arab that support during the seventh year basic level grammar taught in Tunisia. This work proposes to establish morphological analysis by promoting treatments that can be used by a system as the decomposition of a text, determining the properties of a word, the search in a text..., these treatments support learning through an explanation of ambiguous words, the integration strategies of Arabic grammar and solving exercises. © 2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Arabic Language is the language of the Holy Quran. The language is familiar and crucial to all Muslims world wide and Muslims are highly recommended to understand the language of the holy Quran to ease them when reciting the Quran. The Minister of Education has started introducing Arabic language to Muslim's primary school children since 2005 under the JQAF program. However, the implementation of most of the foreign language classes are not really successful as those subjects were taught with little or no regards with the current field-tested paradigm of foreign language acquisition. Many teachers are using almost outdated paradigms of learning for their students. This situation is unproductive for a fast growing learner who wants to acquire knowledge. Therefore, this project is conducted to assist the Malaysian Muslim children to understand the Arabic language better as it is part of the JQAF syllabus. This courseware is specially developed to accompany the primary school Arabic language text book and its scope is to ensure that students know how to manipulate the Arabic words according to its gender. Prior to the development stage of this project, a study towards a suitable instructional design strategies of teaching and learning Arabic language grammar especially in differentiating the masculine and feminine words is conducted. As a result, the storytelling approach has been adapted. Storytelling helps stimulates the children's cognitive skills in recognizing and remembering the words according to its gender. The multimedia elements such as graphic, animation, and audio are fully utilized in this application to create an interesting way of learning and thus gain the students attention. An alpha testing towards the STAr courseware has been conducted to five respondents who are the Year one students. The results shown that 60% of the respondents managed to score 85% marks and above while 40% of the respondents scored at least 67 in the exercise module which included in the STAr courseware. This courseware design can be commercialized and used for developing other courseware to teach other foreign language such as France and German language. ©2010 IEEE.},

This problem has inevitably caused them complications in understanding the basic meanings of Al-Quran words and sentences. Presently, there exists a local technique named Al Furqan, based entirely on surahs from the Al-Quran that teaches Malaysian Muslims in classes to learn Arabic easily without much memorizing and writing, and without any homework. However, the element of interaction and engagement prior and after classes is missing. There is a learning gap which can be filled by mobile learning. Thus, this research work aims to design, develop and test a scaffolded mobile educational game called Easy Arabic for learning Arabic using the Al Furqan technique. The research is based on the developmental approach and consists of four major phases which are theoretical study, prototype design, prototype development and prototype testing. The prototype has been successfully developed and installed on Android platform, and has been tested by a sample of 30 Al Furqan learners. Most of them found this prototype significantly helpful in bridging the learning gap of understanding the basic technique of Al Furqan prior and after classes. © 2014 IEEE.},

For the Arabic language mobile keypads, all Arabic letters are distributed over the 8 buttons of the keypad where three or more letters share the same button. In this paper, a new text entry environment is proposed. The environment includes two proposed improved approaches for Arabic language messages to make the multi-tap text entry method faster and easier. The first approach is based on the idea of remapping the distribution of Arabic letters on the keypad according to the frequency of letters. In the second approach, a bi-Gram based method is used to predict the next letter to be typed automatically. The proposed approaches are evaluated using a corpus of 1514 real Arabic text messages. Several experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed text entry environment. The results of the experiments have showed that using the proposed remapped keypad is faster and consumes less effort in comparison to the classical keypad. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Problem statement: One of language processing approaches that compute a basic analysis of sentence structure rather than attempting full syntactic analysis is shallow syntactic parsing. It is an analysis of a sentence which identifies the constituents (noun groups, verb groups, prepositional groups), but does not specify their internal structure, nor their role in the main sentence. The only technique used for Arabic shallow parser is Support Vector Machine (SVM) based approach. The problem faced by shallow parser developers is the boundary identification which is applied to ensure the generation of high accuracy system performance. Approach: The specific objective of the research was to identify the entire Noun Phrases (NPs), Verb Phrases (VPs) and Prepositional Phrases (PPs) boundaries in the Arabic language. This study discussed various idiosyncrasies of Arabic sentences to derive more accurate rules to detect start and the end boundaries of each clause in an Arabic sentence. New rules were proposed to the shallow parser features up to the generation of two levels from full parse-tree. We described an implementation and evaluate the rule-based shallow parser that handles chunking of Arabic sentences. This research was based on a critical analysis of the Arabic sentences architecture. It discussed various idiosyncrasies of Arabic sentences to derive more accurate rules to detect the start and the end boundaries of each clause in an Arabic sentence. Results: The system was tested manually on 70 Arabic sentences which composed of 1776 words, with the length of the sentences between 4-50 words. The result obtained was significantly better than state of the art Arabic published results, which achieved F-scores of 97%. Conclusion: The main achievement includes the development of Arabic shallow parser based on rule-based approaches. Chunking which constitutes the main contribution is achieved on two successive stages that include grouped sequences of adjacent words on the basis of linguistic properties. © 2011 Science Publications.},

More specifically, this paper examines Moroccan immigrant children's language socialization into pan-Arabic and Islamic identities in relation to the teaching of the Arabic language to these younger generations of Moroccans, who have either already been born in Spain, or who immigrated to Spain with their parents when they were toddlers. Moroccan immigrant children in this study attend Arabic language classes in a Spanish public school-a relatively new program jointly funded by the Spanish and Moroccan Ministries of Education-and in after-school religious classes in a small oratory-mosque run by a local Islamic cultural organization. In this paper, I address similarities and differences in linguistic and literacy practices between these two contexts, paying particular attention to how the internal dynamism of the Moroccan community itself organizes adults' socializing efforts in relation to language education, especially where there may be some conflicting interests in achieving literacy by religious and secular elements of the children's communities of origin. Comparing language and literacy practices in the fields of Arabic language classes at the school and in the mosque allows us to trace homologies, or similarity of organization in linguistic and cultural (re)production, across these two settings, but also to uncover different kinds of strategies teachers engage in and the differential effect pursued by putting these strategies to use in the classroom. Outlining both, processes of homology and heterogeneity, is particularly important to understand the degree of redundancy in language socialization practices, as well as the possible areas of disjuncture that may impinge upon children's ability to negotiate commonality of belonging in their multiple communities. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Indeed, many Arabic dictionaries are found but are not structured and not directly exploitable since they are in flat textual files form. iSPEDAL doesn't contain any duplicated data (roots, prefixes, suffixes, the infixes, the patterns and the derived words). Moreover, for a given word, it provides links to its root, to their associated affixes, and to its patterns. iSPEDAL is supplied automatically from one or several traditional textual dictionaries and is enriched permanently with any Arabic textual corpus using system that we built. This system is composed of a Parser, a Selector, a Classifier, an Extractor, a Comparator, an Analyzer, and a Validator. The Parser allows the transformation of a textual source (dictionary or textual corpus) into a set of words. The Selector determines if a word is new or already exists in iSPEDAL. The Classifier allows to classify a given word and to add it to iSPEDAL as a root or as a derived word. The Extractor uses the Arabic extraction method to deduce the root of all words arriving to this component without their root or any indication about their root. The Comparator permits to avoid duplication of roots, affixes or patterns in iSPEDAL. The Analyzer allows the extraction of the affixes and the pattern from a derived word and of its root. The Validator can validate the information (word, root, patterns, and affixes) before adding to iSPEDAL database. This dictionary can be used to evaluate the information extraction methods from an Arabic document, given that; the vocabulary of the Arabic language is essentially built from the roots. © 2010 IEEE.},

The Arabic language is based on schemes; lemmas are produced using derivation based on roots and schemes. This latter character presents two major advantages: First, this “hidden side” of the Arabic language composed of schemes suffers much less from sparseness since it represents a finite set, second, schemes keep a large number of features of the language in a much reduced vocabulary size. Schemes present a very great perspective and have great potential in building accurate natural language processing tools for Arabic. In this work we tried to explore this potential by building some NLP tools while relying entirely on schemes.

This study is an applied quantitative method research. The research instruments are two researcher-made questionnaires for measuring the teachers’ and students’ viewpoints. The population involves all male and female Arabic teachers of Kerman city, as well as male and female Mathematics and Science junior high school students of all public high schools of Kerman city. The research sample was selected through stratified random sampling method, and amounted to 30 female Arabic teachers, 30 male Arabic teachers and 236 students. The findings revealed that Arabic language teaching goal is not consistent with the learners’ and society’s needs; Arabic textbooks’ content does not meet the content selection standards set in curriculum planning; Arabic teachers are not well prepared for Arabic language teaching; Arabic curriculum goals are not met; students’ proficiency in Arabic language skills is disappointing; students’ interest in Arabic language and learning, is moderately low; and finally, students’ acquaintance with Arabic language learning strategies is low. Accordingly, we can conclude that the increase in Arabic language teaching efficiency in schools needs more efforts to prepare the society with positive attitude towards Arabic language and Arab people, and also to change the educational approach to Arabic language teaching/learning in our school system. © 2015, Tarbiat Modares University.

This is, in our knowledge, the only open source dictionary project that provides morphological information in addition to the meaning of the input Arabic word. By analyzing the dictionary, we noticed that it has a great weakness in the morphological analysis of the input word. Thus, we have improved the morphological analysis step by developing a module based on the lemma extraction step of the system "Al-Khalil 2". In addition, we expanded the database with the words available in the "Almusotako$if" dictionary. © Technomathematics Research Foundation.},

According to literature, there are twelve misconceptions that lead to the matter of lack of concern in Arabic language listening skills. The followings are the main factors that need to be obtained by the student, such as speaking, reading and writing without training and other language skills, as well as misconception which is involving the activity of teaching listening skills passively. Thus, the aim of this study is to identify teachers' misconception about the Arabic language listening skills. The research design of the study is a cross sectional by using a questionnaire to collect the research data. The respondents of the study were 100 Arabic language teachers who were selected randomly. The results demonstrated that the major misconceptions of listening skills among teachers is based on these findings: Arabic language listening skills can be indirectly acquired by the students while practicing Arabic language; teachers do not need to train listening skills, specifically in the classroom; Arabic language listening skills can be acquired automatically by integration with the reading skills practices; obtaining Arabic reading comprehension skills is more important than learn listening skills; obtaining comprehension skills of Arabic language is more necessary than learning listening skills; listening skills is not necessary in learning Arabic language; the activity which is connected to listening skills in the class cause emotional burden; eveiy activity of Arabic listening in the class sometimes can cause bored and frustrated. Thus, the lack of concern in teaching Arabic language listening skills is referring to the matter of misconception among Arabic teachers. © Medwell Journals, 2013.},

However, some studies demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference between gender in the use of LLS. Others showed that male students use more LLS than female students in certain categories. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not differences exist between female and male Arabic students in the use of language learning strategies. A total of 457 students at thirteen secondary schools in Terengganu, Malaysia participated in the study. Data was collected using a questionnaire adapted and modified from SILL (Oxford 1990). The findings of the study showed that there was significant gender difference in the use of language learning strategies as a whole. Female students also tend to use overall language learning strategies more often than males. For categories of language learning strategies, there are significant differences between genders in the use of affective and metaphysic strategies with females using them more often.},

Two of these rules are universal, i.e. they are applicable to any word category, and one rule for each of the four categories: nouns, verbs, adverbs and adjectives. The rules were more successful in case of adverbs. As for nouns, verbs and adjectives, some errors occurred especially in case of suffix processing. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

Quantitative data were analysed using SPSS 17, involving 445 samples which were chosen by using the stratified random sampling technique. Qualitative data were analysed using NVIVO7 engaging 13 interviews with students. The study found that, overall; the level of self-efficacy among the students was high. Further investigation found that self-efficacy towards success in the oral Arabic course in UiTM was high while self-efficacy towards mastering oral Arabic in general was moderate. This study suggests that the concept of self-efficacy should be implemented and nurtured among students and it should be in line with their different abilities in oral Arabic. On the other hand, authentic learning materials should also be used in learning in order to become an ultimate benchmark in learning oral Arabic.},

	abstract = {The paper reports the findings of a survey study which examined attitudes towards a range of language policies for the Arabic language in Israel. Arabic is an official language in Israel as a result of a Mandatory Order (1922) which dictates comprehensive Hebrew-Arabic bilingual conduct by state authorities. In practice, Arabic's public position in Israel is marginal, and Hebrew is the dominant language in Israeli public spheres. Arabic speakers, a national indigenous minority, and Jewish immigrants from the Former Soviet Union, form the two largest language-minority groups in Israel. The study explored attitudes concerning (1) the use of Arabic in three public domains (government services, public television, and teaching of Arabic in Jewish schools), (2) a Hebrew-Arabic bilingual model, and (3) a multilingual model addressing language minorities in Israel in general. Respondents were 466 university and college students, Jews and Arabs, divided into five subgroups along linguistic, ethnic and religious lines. The main findings indicated (1) a clear hierarchy of language policy domains among all five subgroups, with 'government services' being the most favored domain; (2) a tendency among Jewish respondents to favor a multilingual policy over a Hebrew-Arabic bilingual one; and (3) a language minority element (non-native Hebrew speakers), overshadowed by the ethnic-religious (Jewish-Arab) element.},

	abstract = {In this article, we propose a new structured and progressive electronic dictionary for the Arab language (DESELA) which can be presented in the form of a relational database or in the form of an XML document which can be easily exploitable using suitable query languages. Indeed, many Arab dictionaries are found but are not directly exploitable since they are in flat textual files form. DESELA contains the roots, the prefixes, the suffixes, the infixes, the patterns and the derived words. Moreover, for a given word, it provides links to its root, to their associated affixes, and to its possible pattern. DESELA is supplied automatically from one or several traditional textual dictionaries and is enriched permanently with any Arab textual corpus using system that we built. This system is composed of a parser, a classifier, a comparator and an analyzer. The parser allows transforming a textual source (dictionary or textual corpus) into a set of words. The classifier allows to classify a given word and to add it to DESELA as a root or a derived word. The analyzer allows extracting the affixes and the model from a derived word and of its root. The comparator permits to avoid duplication of roots, affixes or patterns in DESELA. This dictionary can be used to evaluate the information extraction methods from an Arab document, given that; the vocabulary of the Arab language is essentially built from the roots. In general, an Arab word is built from its root while adding to it the affixes (prefix, infix, or suffix) according to a precise pattern. Most methods of information extraction starting from an Arab document proceed conversely by extracting the root from the mot.},

Moreover, the proposed model is speaker-independent and uses visemes as the basic units, thereby, making it applicable to any set of words of varying size or content. © 2011 IEEE.},

Many new Christians of Muslim origin (Moriscos) tried to break this identification in an effort to salvage part of their culture, and specially the language, by separating it from Islam. I will argue that the Morisco forgery known as the Lead Books of the Sacromonte in Granada-an Arabic Evangile dictated by the Virgin Mary to Arabic disciples who came to Spain with the Apostle Saint James-was part of this effort. When the Lead Books were taken to the Vatican to be informed, they were studied by Maronite scholars who decided that they were written in "Muslim Arabic" and therefore could not be authentic Christian texts. The Maronites were engaged in creating and consolidating their own version of Christian Arabic to define and legitimise their own position inside the Roman world. The second part of the essay adresses the theological considerations and the defence of different cultural identities which are implied in these different versions of Arabic. © 2009 Brill.},

Two human experts have evaluated the speech of all speakers for mispronunciation, and evaluation show that the nature of errors is almost the same for all nationalities under investigation with the fact that pharyngeal, alveodental, and interdental sounds are difficult to pronounce by learners of Arabic. Some of the errors are due to sounds that are not present in mother languages or the learner is unable to pronounce the phoneme correctly due to similar place of production or/and manner of articulation. An interesting observation is that pronunciation errors of some learners are due to switching pairs of phonemes. © 2014 IEEE.},

We study three approaches to obtain the global conversion function of the pitch and the overall spectrum, using the joint probability model. In the first approach, we calculate the joint conversion of pitch and spectrum. In the second approach, the pitch is calculated by linear conversion. In the third approach, we use the relationship between the pitch and the spectrum. For the conversion of noise we use a new technique that consists in modeling the noise of the voiced or unvoiced frames by GMMs. We use the HNM for analysis/synthesis and a regularized discrete cepstrum in order to estimate the spectrum of the speech signal. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.},

	abstract = {Prosodic features are important for the intelligibility and proficiency of stress-timed languages such as English and Arabic. Producing the appropriate lexical stress is challenging for second language (L2) learners, in particular, those whose first language (L1) is a syllable-timed language such as Spanish, French, etc. In this paper we introduce a method for automatic classification of lexical stress to be integrated into computer-aided pronunciation learning (CAPL) tools for L2 learning. We trained two different deep learning architectures, the deep feedforward neural network (DNN) and the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) using a set of temporal and spectral features related to the intensity, duration, pitch and energies in different frequency bands. The system was applied on both English (kids and adult) and Arabic (adult) speech corpora collected from native speakers. Our method results in error rates of 9%, 7% and 18% when tested on the English children corpus, English adult corpus and Arabic adult corpus respectively. Copyright © 2016 ISCA.},

	abstract = {The study of students’ motivation and attitude towards the usage of second language (L2) has recently become an important concept across the disciplines of second language acquisition and communication. This paper highlights the result of the survey questionnaire adopted from Gardner’s (2009) attitude motivation test battery that was administered among 288 Arabic students from six universities in Nigeria. Principal component analysis was carried out to determine the validity of the items in the Nigerian context. 23 out of the 50 items with factor loading <0.40 loaded on four factors with eigenvalue <1.0. Descriptive statistics, Pearson product moment correlation and multiple regression analyses were used to explore the students’ attitude and motivation towards the learning of Arabic language. The four constructs of the questionnaire are: Integrativeness, attitudes toward the learning situation, motivation and instrumentality. The result showed that students have high level of both integrativeness and attitude towards the state of arts of learning, while their level of motivation and instrumentality is very low. In addition to that, there is positive and moderate correlation between integrativenness and attitude towards the state of arts of learning, while the correlation between attitude and motivation is very low. The same thing is applicable to integrativeness and motivation. Instrumentality, however, fails to correlate with any of the factors. The multiple regression analysis showed that attitude toward the state of arts of learning is a good predictor of the students’ integrativeness. In the fi nal analysis, some pedagogical recommendations were put forth in the paper to improve the students’ motivation and positive attitude towards the learning of Arabic language in the Nigerian universities. © 2015, Econjournals.

	abstract = {Arabic is a widely spoken language but few mining tools have been developed to process Arabic text. This paper examines the crime domain in the Arabic language (unstructured text) using text mining techniques. The development and application of a Crime Profiling System (CPS) is presented. The system is able to extract meaningful information, in this case the type of crime, location and nationality, from Arabic language crime news reports. The system has two unique attributes; firstly, information extraction that depends on local grammar, and secondly, dictionaries that can be automatically generated. It is shown that the CPS improves the quality of the data through reduction where only meaningful information is retained. Moreover, the Self Organising Map (SOM) approach is adopted in order to perform the clustering of the crime reports, based on crime type. This clustering technique is improved because only refined data containing meaningful keywords extracted through the information extraction process are inputted into it, i.e. the data are cleansed by removing noise. The proposed system is validated through experiments using a corpus collated from different sources; it was not used during system development. Precision, recall and F-measure are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed information extraction approach. Also, comparisons are conducted with other systems. In order to evaluate the clustering performance, three parameters are used: data size, loading time and quantization error. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Problem statement: Grammatical Relation (GR) can be defined as a linguistic relation established by grammar, where linguistic relation is an association among the linguistic forms or constituents. Fundamentally the GR determines grammatical behaviors such as: placement of a word in a clause, verb agreement and the passivity behavior. The GR of Arabic language is a necessary prerequisite for many natural language processing applications, such as machine translation and information retrieval. This study focuses on the GR related problems of Arabic language and addresses the issue with optimum solution. Approach: We had proposed a rule based production method to recognize Grammatical Relations (GRs), as the rule-based approach had been successfully used in developing many natural language processing systems. In order to eradicate the problems of sentence structure recognition, the proposed technique enhances the basic representations of Arabic language such as: Noun Phrase (NP), Verb Phrase (VP), Preposition Phrase (PP) and Adjective Phrase (AP). We had implemented and evaluated the Rule-Based approach that handles chunking and GRs of Arabic sentences. Results: The system was manually tested on 80 Arabic sentences, with the length of each sentence ranging from 3-20 words. The results had yielded the F-score of 83.60%. This outcome proves the viability of this approach for Arabic sentences of GRs extraction. Conclusion: The main achievement of this study is development of Arabic grammatical relation extractions based ob rule-based approaches. © 2012 Science Publications.},

In the formation of this conception and association, the Arabic language is often a key factor. The aim of this paper is therefore to analyse how, within a group of Moroccan migrants living in Madrid, the construction of Arab ethno-linguistic identity in the context of migration and Diaspora is tied up with their collective Muslim identity, and how this group legitimates this interrelation. We also aim to examine the argumentation and legitimation strategies by means of which our informants discursively reproduce or reply to the model for constructing an Arab-Muslim identity by using the technique of group discussion. Finally, we attempt to identify to what extent there are discursive positions that call for an ethno-linguistic vitality are significant, as well as in terms of identity, on behalf of a minority Arab linguistic community that tries to resist forms of assimilation, sociolinguistic stratification and power relations in which it is bound up both at the local and regional level and, moreover, at a national level. © Universidad de Alcalá.},

Evaluations of results and descriptions were then compared to assess their conformity. The core finding was that Google performed almost all the times better than the other engines. The difference to Yahoo was however not statically significant, and the difference to the third ranked engine MSN was significant to a low degree. The Arabic search engine Araby showed performance on most of the evaluation measures, while Ayna was far behind all other search engines.

This study is based on the Gardner's socio-educational model, and focuses on two types of motivational orientation, which are integrative and instrumental, and attitudes toward the learning conditions. The main purpose of this study is to identify the level of integrative orientation, attitudes toward the learning conditions and instrumental orientation among students in a Distance Learning (DL) program at the Faculty of Islamic Studies (FPI), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM, The National University of Malaysia). This study used a quantitative research design. Data were collected through questionnaires and analyzed descriptively. A total of 170 distance learning students were selected using the simple random sampling technique. Findings show that the students possessed a high level of integrative orientation and their attitudes toward learning environment were positive. The level of instrumental orientation, on the other hand, was very high with the instrumental orientation obtaining the highest mean score. One of the implications that can be drawn from this study is that teachers and students need to take into account and emphasize integrative orientation, attitudes toward learning conditions and instrumental orientation in order to develop a positive attitude in students who aim to master the Arabic language. Other than that, educational institutions should provide support and carry out other related activities and programs in order to ensure that students consistently have positive attitudes whilst achieving excellent results in learning the Arabic language.},

	abstract = {The paper describes some of the work carried out within the European funded project MEDAR. The project has three streams of activity: the technical stream, the cooperation stream and the dissemination stream. MEDAR has first updated the existing surveys and BLARK for Arabic, and then the technical stream focused on machine translation. The consortium identified a number of freely available MT systems and then customized two versions of the famous MOSES package. The Consortium addressed the needs to package MOSES for English to Arabic (while the main MT stream is on Arabic to English). For performance assessment purposes, the partners produced test data that allowed carrying out an evaluation campaign with 5 different systems (including from outside the consortium) and two online ones. Both the MT baselines and the collected data will be made available via ELRA catalogue. The cooperation stream focuses mostly on the cooperation roadmap for Human Language Technologies for Arabic. Cooperation Roadmap for the region directed towards the Arabic HLT in general. It is the purpose of the roadmap to outline areas and priorities for collaboration, in terms of collaboration between EU countries and Arabic speaking countries, as well as cooperation in general: between countries, between universities, and last but not least between universities and industry.},

In this study we present a new approach for the realization of a statistical model of Arabic language for non-vocalized texts. This approach allows to overcome the morphological complexity of the Arabic language and to address the limitations of existing morphological analyzers. Indeed the classic approach adopted by most of the morphological analyzers, bring the word out of its context and therefore generate several options for segmentation. Our solution proposes using trellises at a time to keep the possibilities of segmentation generated by the morphological analyzer and then create the model language. In order to realize this solution, we have used these tools: AraMorph and Lattice-Tool from the box SRILM and AT & WSF. The language was estimated from a corpus composed of 100 K words and has been tested on a corpus of 7 K words. The results and analysis are presented in this document. © 2014 IEEE.},

The results presented in this paper are based on a comprehensive study that was carried out using 8,538 text samples from these five forums. The sample topics are categorized into nine categories: political, social, economic, academic, religious, scientific, sports, arts, and others. The effect of topic is analyzed on several Arabic language aspects including the language whether Arabic, English, or mixed; the alphabet whether Arabic, English, or Arabizi; the dialect whether standard, colloquial, or mixed; the use of symbols; the style whether normal, metaphor, cynical, vulgar, or other; and the text cohesion level. This paper shows that there are large differences found in these six language aspects among the nine topic categories. Most notably, standard and refined language is common in serious topics such as religion and politics. Colloquial Arabic dialect and weak cohesion with Arabizi alphabet is common in casual topics such as social and academic topics. © 2015 IEEE.},

This work describes the development and implementation of Arabic Named Entity Recognition System (ANER system) for the Arabic Language. For identification and classification Named Entities (NEs) in the text such as persons, locations, organizations and temporal values. NER plays a significant role in various types of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, especially in information extraction, information retrieval, machine translation, syntactic parsing/chunking and question-answering. The NER task was considerably more challenging when it was targeting a morphologically complex language such as Arabic due to its complexity. The Arabic language has some peculiarities which harden the NER task. Arabic has a rich and complex morphology. The main aim of this research was to use the rule based approach to design and implement an Arabic NER system for the political domain. The rule based approach consisted of a lexicon, in the form of verb contextual clue lists and the noun contextual clue list, together with a set of grammar rules which were responsible for recognizing and classifying NEs. Considering the system evaluations tested on ANER corpus. Taken human annotated corpus and evaluated the system and then compared the results against this corpus. The accuracy was 94.86% of ANER system, the results showed that the approach achieved an accuracy of 82.76% for Person NE, 98.3% for Location, 100% for Organization and 98.37% for MISC. © 2014 Knowledgia Review, Malaysia.},

Syntax analysis receives all the tokens and finds the best grammar for the given sequence of the tokens by using context free grammar.

Therefore, many teacher standards have been devised, such as the NBPTS in the United States and the Malaysian Teacher Standards by the Malaysian Ministry of Education. However, there is still the question of their suitability to be used to determine and measure the quality of the Arabic teachers due to the ambiguity of definition and elements used therein. Apart from that, the existence of the one-fit-all quality measurement is also questioned. This paper presents the synthesis study that looks into the methods of how teacher effectiveness in general is measured in the recent teacher assessment studies. The importance of local elements in the quality study is also discussed. This study also takes into consideration the recommendations made by previous studies in the determination of the definition of the student achievement construct as a tool to evaluate the effectiveness and quality of teachers. The Malaysian Teacher Standards are also discussed appropriate to its status within the Malaysian education system. All of the findings are synthesised by the development of a new and comprehensive assessment framework for the quality evaluation of the Arabic teachers from the perspective of Arabic language education in Malaysia. From the synthesis study, the writer would like to propose a logical and practical framework in the teacher assessment field especially for the Arabic Language teachers in Malaysia. © 2015 Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences.

	abstract = {Arabic morphological analysers and stemming algorithms have become a popular area of research. Many computational linguists have designed and developed algorithms to solve the problem of morphology and stemming. Each researcher proposed his own gold standard, testing methodology and accuracy measurements to test and compute the accuracy of his algorithm. Therefore, we cannot make comparisons between these algorithms. In this paper we have accomplished two tasks. First, we proposed four different fair and precise accuracy measurements and two 1000-word gold standards taken from the Holy Qur'an and from the Corpus of Contemporary Arabic. Second, we combined the results from the morphological analysers and stemming algorithms by voting after running them on the sample documents. The evaluation of the algorithms shows that Arabic morphology is still a challenge. © 2008. Licensed under the Creative Commons.},

The first version of ANERsys was totally based on the Maximum Entropy approach and was trained and tested with corpora which we have built ourselves. The results showed that the Maximum Entropy is an appropriate method to identify Named Entities in Arabic texts. However, in order to reach higher performance a greater effort needed to be done to improve the recognition of long proper names. Therefore, in the second version of ANERsys, we use a Part Of Speech tagger and a two-steps approach to enhance the performance of the system. Furthermore, we have used our own (now freely available on our website) corpora (ANERcorp) and gazetteers (ANERgazet) to train and evaluate ANERsys 2.0. We carried out several experiments to evaluate the performance of the system and to compare it with the online freely available demo version of the commercial system Siraj (Sakhr). The results show that the accuracy of the new version is 10 points above the old one and more than 7 points above the Siraj (Sakhr) system accuracy. Copyright © 2007 IICAI.},

The past three decades witnessed an increased interest in Human Language Technology. One of the research areas where Human Language Technology played a significant role is the area of Natural Language Interfaces to Databases. A natural language interface to a database provides an easy channel of communication with computer systems. However, most of the work in this area was done in English and other Indo-European languages. Work in Arabic was very limited. This can be attributed to the scarce language resources in Arabic and the fact that Arabic is a very challenging language for computer analysis. This paper discusses the design of an Arabic Web-based natural language interface to a relational database. The initial results of our work are very encouraging and we highly believe that our approach will open the door to extensive research in Arabic language processing. © 2009 IEEE.},

The computations involve: Hamming Window, Fourier Transformation, Average Spectral Value (ASV), Logarithm of ASV, Normalized Energy, as well as, the first and second order time derivatives of 13-coefficients. A combination of a Hidden Markov Model and a Neural Network Approach was used in order to model the basic temporal nature of the speech signal. The results obtained by testing the recognizer system with 7841 tri-phones. 13-coefficients indicates accuracy level of 58%. 39-coeefficents indicates 62%. With Cepstrum Mean Normalization, there is an indication of 71%. With this small available data-only 620 sentences-these results are very encouraging.},

During the last few years the information retrieval community has attacked this problem for English using standard IR techniques with only mediocre success. We are tackling this problem for Arabic using traditional Information Retrieval (IR) techniques coupled with a sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach. To identify the answer, we adopt a keyword matching strategy along with matching simple structures extracted from both the question and the candidate documents selected by the IR system. To achieve this goal, we use an existing tagger to identify proper names and other crucial lexical items and build lexical entries for them on the fly. We also carry out an analysis of Arabic question forms and attempt a better understanding of what kinds of answers users find satisfactory. The paucity of studies of real users has limited results in earlier research. © SEMITIC@ACL 2002.All right reserved.},

	abstract = {Currently, there are more than 200 readability formulas developed since the 1920s. Only a handful of these formulas are reliable to determine the reading-level of a sample text. Ascertaining the readability of curricula is an important step toward optimizing the effectiveness of the educational progress. Readability measurements are done using manual computation. This is a tedious and timeconsuming task. However, nowadays, automatic readability computation has gained much popularity than ever before. This can be attributed to the advancement in the field of natural language processing. Languages such as English and Spanish have benefited from the formation of automatic readability systems. Absence of automated readability measurement of Arabic texts and the large amount of information which are written in Arabic encouraged us to work on finding an automatic readability system for our language; the mother language for millions of Arabs. In this paper we will review the different readability research and then propose a system for automating the readability measurement of Arabic text. Within the paper we also report the results of our pilot experiment carried out on the different well-known Arabic, Swedish and English readability formulas. © 2008 IEEE.},

In this paper, we begin to reconcile the subjective and automated scores that underlie these correlations by explicitly "grounding" MT output with its Reference Translation (RT) prior to subjective or automated evaluation. The first two phases of our approach annotate {MT, RT} pairs with the same types of textual comparisons that subjects intuitively apply, while the third phase (not presented here) entails scoring the pairs: (i) automated calculation of "MT-RT hits" using CMU aligner from METEOR, (ii) an extension phase where our Buckwalter-based Lookup Tool serves to generate six other textual comparison categories on items in the MT output that the CMU aligner does not identify, and (iii) given the fully categorized RT & MT pair, a final adequacy score is assigned to the MT output, either by an automated metric based on weighted category counts and segment length, or by a trained human judge.},

We use the backpropagation algorithm in a simple recurrent network. A sentence is analyzed word by word. Every word is introduced to the network according to its semantic features. The task of the network consists of reading the sentence and deciding on a suitable semantic role for each word. The network successfully learned a case role assignment task. It has been experimented with on several corpora. The network has also been tested on a composed corpus of different sizes of sentences (2, 3, 4 and more), and a generalization rate approaching 92% was obtained. © 2001 IEEE.},

Design: The core elements of the SWQ were translated into Arabic, back-translated, and pilot tested to ascertain cultural sensitivity and appropriateness for both men and women in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). A convenience sample (N=260) of smoking and nonsmoking adults completed a demographic sheet and the Arabic Readiness to Stop Smoking Questionnaire (A-RSSQ). Pre-and post tests were conducted on a smaller sample. Methods: Researchers used methods to assure accuracy of content and understanding of concepts across cultures. Cronbach's alpha and Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated to evaluate instrument development. Findings: The scale showed internal consistency. Pre-and post test stability was supportive of respondents' consistent attitudes over 2 weeks at both the item and scale level. Construct validity was shown for both men and women in that scores for smokers were significantly lower than for nonsmokers. The alpha reliability coefficient was .78 for the total scale. Conclusions: The A-RSSQ showed initial reliability and validity for men and women. It is useful as a cost-effective means for identifying people in the EMR who are ready to stop smoking.},

	abstract = {Speech is the most natural and widespread form of human communication. That is why speech synthesis has interested researchers for decades. It turns out that developing an unlimited text-to-speech system is an enormous task. The traditional methods (synthesis by rule and synthesis by concatenation of pre-recorded sounds) used for this have not given good results. In such a situation, neural networks (NNs) have the potential to give better results thanks to their property of interpolation and their capacity of generalisation. We present a synthesis system for the Arabic language. The choice of parameters which will be used to drive the NN is very important and have an effective influence on the quality of produced speech. Work has been done to evaluate different methods based on linear predictive coding; the resulting speech was machine-like and not intelligible. We suggest to use CELP to drive the NN, which provides high quality speech. © 2001 IEEE.},

This is why this paper focuses on topic identification for this language. Thus, we have used three statistical methods for this task: the TFIDF classifier, the SVM method and the Topic Unigram Language Model. The first step we have made is collecting Arabic corpora and representing them with an adequate format which is suitable for the methods cited above. The corpus that we have extracted from the Arabic newspaper "Alkhabar", is composed of 6000 news articles corresponding to nearly 3 millions of words. It covers four topics: Local news, Economy, International news and Sport. According to our experiments, the results are encouraging, particularly if we compare them with those found for French language. However we have noticed the superiority of the SVM classifier and its high capability to distinguish topics. In addition we have shown the effect of vocabulary size in results enhancement. Other experiments have been conducted to determine the minimum of words necessary in order to achieve acceptable results. This is particularly interesting for speech recognition when language adaptation is needed.},

Educated Tunisians still feel ill at ease using Arabic in talking, writing or in their daily life activities. Moreover, the prevailing attitude of most of them towards Arabic is hardly that of pride, strong commitment or willingness to defend or protect it. The socio-psychological perspective adopted in this paper attributes such alienation primarily to the ideology of the Tunisian political leadership, and to the fact that the educated Tunisians themselves are bilingual and bicultural with strong affinities with the French language and culture. The educated elite have, since independence, occupied sensitive key governmental positions, and strongly encouraged the continued presence of the French language and culture. Independence from the French linguistic and cultural influence was hardly present on the agendas of these political, intellectual and scientific elite. It was equally absent from the agendas of most of the bilingual and bicultural Tunisian post-independence society.},
