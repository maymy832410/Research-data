	abstract = {Translator Stylometry is a small but growing area of research in computational linguistics. Despite the research proliferation on the wider research field of authorship attribution using computational linguistics techniques, the translator stylometry problem is more challenging and there is no sufficient literature on the topic. Some authors even claimed that this problem does not have a solution; a claim we will challenge in this paper. We present an innovative set of translator stylometric features that can be used as signatures to detect and identify translators. The features are based on the concept of network motifs: small graph local substructures which have been used successfully in characterizing global network dynamics. The text is transformed into a network, where words become nodes and their adjacencies in a sentence are represented through links. Motifs of size 3 are then extracted from this network and their distribution is used as a signature for the corresponding translator. We then investigate the impact of sample size, method of normalization and imbalance dataset on classification accuracy. We also adopt the Fuzzy Lattice Reasoning Classifier (FLR) among others, where FLR achieved the best performance with a classification accuracy reaching the 70% mark. © 2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by serious difficulties with the social use of language, along with impaired social functioning and ritualistic/repetitive behaviors (American Psychiatric Association in Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-5, 5th edn. American Psychiatric Association, Arlington, 2013). While substantial heterogeneity exists in symptom expression, impairments in language discourse skills, including narrative (or storytelling), are universally observed in autism (Tager-Flusberg et al. in Handbook on autism and pervasive developmental disorders, 3rd edn. Wiley, New York, pp 335–364, 2005). This study applied a computational linguistic tool, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), to objectively characterize narrative performance in high-functioning individuals with autism and typically-developing controls, across two different narrative contexts that differ in the interpersonal and cognitive demands placed on the narrator. Results indicated that high-functioning individuals with autism produced narratives comparable in semantic content to those produced by controls when narrating from a picture book, but produced narratives diminished in semantic quality in a more demanding narrative recall task. This pattern is similar to that detected from analyses of hand-coded picture book narratives in prior research, and extends findings to an additional narrative context that proves particularly challenging for individuals with autism. Results are discussed in terms of the utility of LSA as a quantitative, objective, and efficient measure of narrative ability. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

In such documents, system behavior is specified in the form of scenarios, written as a sequence of sentences in natural language. The scenarios are often incomplete: For the authors of requirements documents some facts are so obvious that they forget to mention them. This surely causes problems for the requirements analyst. This paper presents an approach that analyzes textual scenarios with the means of computational linguistics, identifies where communicating objects or whole actions are missing in the text, completes the missing information, and creates a message sequence chart (MSC) including the information missing in the textual scenario. Finally, this MSC is presented to the requirements analyst for validation. The paper presents also a case study in which scenarios from a requirement document based on industrial specifications were translated to MSCs. The case study shows the feasibility of the approach. © 2007 IEEE.},

We target the connection between data and theory in second language (L2) research and highlight opportunities to (a) enrich the options for obtaining data and (b) support the identification and valid interpretation of relevant learner data. We first characterize options, limitations, and potential for obtaining rich data on learning: from Web-based intervention studies supporting the collection of experimentally controlled data to online workbooks facilitating large-scale, longitudinal corpus collection for a range of learning tasks and proficiency levels. We then turn to the question of how corpus data can systematically be used for L2 research, focusing on the central role that linguistic corpus annotation plays in that regard. We show that learner language poses particular challenges to human and CL analysis and requires more interdisciplinary discussion of analysis frameworks and advances in annotation schemes. © 2017 Language Learning Research Club, University of Michigan},

Here, we present a more informative AZ scheme with 15 categories in place of the original 7, and show that it can be applied to the life sciences as well as to CL. We use a domain expert to encode basic knowledge about the subject (such as terminology and domain specific rules for individual categories) as part of the annotation guidelines. Our results show that non-expert human coders can then use these guidelines to reliably annotate this scheme in two domains, chemistry and computational linguistics. © 2009 ACL and AFNLP.},

Ten years after Ted Pedersen’s influential “Last Words” contribution in Computational Linguistics, we investigate to what extent researchers in computational linguistics are willing and able to share their data and code. We surveyed all 395 full papers presented at the 2011 and 2016 ACL Annual Meetings, and identified whether links to data and code were provided. If working links were not provided, authors were requested to provide this information. Although data were often available, code was shared less often. When working links to code or data were not provided in the paper, authors provided the code in about one third of cases. For a selection of ten papers, we attempted to reproduce the results using the provided data and code. We were able to reproduce the results approximately for six papers. For only a single paper did we obtain the exact same results. Our findings show that even though the situation appears to have improved comparing 2016 to 2011, empiricism in computational linguistics still largely remains a matter of faith. Nevertheless, we are somewhat optimistic about the future. Ensuring reproducibility is not only important for the field as a whole, but also seems worthwhile for individual researchers: The median citation count for studies with working links to the source code is higher. © 2018, 2018 Association for Computational Linguistics Published under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license.},

	abstract = {Background: The global onset of COVID-19 has resulted in substantial public health and socioeconomic impacts. An immediate medical breakthrough is needed. However, parallel to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic is the proliferation of information regarding the pandemic, which, if uncontrolled, cannot only mislead the public but also hinder the concerted efforts of relevant stakeholders in mitigating the effect of this pandemic. It is known that media communications can affect public perception and attitude toward medical treatment, vaccination, or subject matter, particularly when the population has limited knowledge on the subject. Objective: This study attempts to systematically scrutinize media communications (Google News headlines or snippets and Twitter posts) to understand the prevailing sentiments regarding COVID-19 vaccines in Africa. Methods: A total of 637 Twitter posts and 569 Google News headlines or descriptions, retrieved between February 2 and May 5, 2020, were analyzed using three standard computational linguistics models (ie, TextBlob, Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner, and Word2Vec combined with a bidirectional long short-term memory neural network). Results: Our findings revealed that, contrary to general perceptions, Google News headlines or snippets and Twitter posts within the stated period were generally passive or positive toward COVID-19 vaccines in Africa. It was possible to understand these patterns in light of increasingly sustained efforts by various media and health actors in ensuring the availability of factual information about the pandemic. Conclusions: This type of analysis could contribute to understanding predominant polarities and associated potential attitudinal inclinations. Such knowledge could be critical in informing relevant public health and media engagement policies. © Sefater Gbashi, Oluwafemi Ayodeji Adebo, Wesley Doorsamy, Patrick Berka Njobeh.},

Here we analyze open-ended textual responses of citizens and scientists concerning their associations with the terms “economic growth” and “green growth”. We derive from the responses a number of topics and examine how associations differ across distinct opinion segments of people, namely supporters of Green growth, Agrowth and Degrowth. The results indicate that the general public is more critical of the notion of economic growth than academic researchers. Citizens stress problems of corruption, social inequality, unemployment and poverty, with less variation among the three opinion segments compared to scientists. The latter more strongly emphasize the environmental consequences of economic growth. Concerning associations of scientists with the term “green growth”, we find topics questioning its feasibility to be more likely expressed by Degrowth supporters, while topics stressing the possibility of sustainable economic growth by Green growth supporters. We find that topic polarization is stronger for scientists than citizens. Our results provide further validation for opinion clusters identified in previous studies and uncover additional insights about related views on growth and sustainability. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Consideration of the question of meaning in the framework of linguistics often requires an allusion to sets and other higher-order notions. The traditional approach to representing and reasoning about meaning in a computational setting has been to use knowledge representation sys 7 tems that are either based on first-order logic or that use mechanisms whose formal justifications are to be provided after the fact. In this paper we shall consider the use of a higher-order logic for this task. We first present a version of definite clauses (positive Horn clauses) that is based on this logic. Predicate and function variables may occur in such clauses and the terms in the language are the typed h-terms. Such term structures have a richness that may be exploited in representing meanings. We also describe a higher-order logic programming language, called ~Prolog, which represents programs as higher-order definite clauses and interprets them using a depth-first interpreter. A virtue of this language is that it is possible to write programs in it that integrate syntactic and semantic analyses into one computational paradigm. This is to be contrasted with the more common practice of using two entirely different computation paradigms, such as DCGs or ATNs for parsing and frames or semantic nets for semantic processing. We illustrate such an integration in this language by considering a simple example, and we claim that its use makes the task of providing formal justifications for the computations specified much more direct. © 1986 Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

	abstract = {Background: There is an emerging body of literature suggesting that the evidence-practice divide in health policy is complex and multi-factorial but less is known about the processes by which health policy-makers use evidence and their views about the specific features of useful evidence. This study aimed to contribute to understandings of how the most influential health policy-makers view useful evidence, in ways that help explore and question how the evidence-policy divide is understood and what research might be supported to help overcome this divide. Methods. A purposeful sample of 18 national and state health agency CEOs from 9 countries was obtained. Participants were interviewed using open-ended questions that asked them to define specific features of useful evidence. The analysis involved two main approaches 1)quantitative mapping of interview transcripts using Bayesian-based computational linguistics software 2)qualitative critical discourse analysis to explore the nuances of language extracts so identified. Results: The decision-making, conclusions-oriented world of policy-making is constructed separately, but not exclusively, by policy-makers from the world of research. Research is not so much devalued by them as described as too technical yet at the same time not methodologically complex enough to engage with localised policy-making contexts. It is not that policy-makers are negative about academics or universities, it is that they struggle to find complexity-oriented methodologies for understanding their stakeholder communities and improving systems. They did not describe themselves as having a more positive role in solving this challenge than academics. Conclusions: These interviews do not support simplistic definitions of policy-makers and researchers as coming from two irreconcilable worlds. They suggest that qualitative and quantitative research is valued by policy-makers but that to be policy-relevant health research may need to focus on building complexity-oriented research methods for local community health and service development. Researchers may also need to better explain and develop the policy-relevance of large statistical generalisable research designs. Policy-makers and public health researchers wanting to serve local community needs may need to be more proactive about questioning whether the dominant definitions of research quality and the research funding levers that drive university research production are appropriately inclusive of excellence in such policy-relevant research. © 2012 Bell and Seidel; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {In recent months, many governments have announced COVID-19 vaccination programs and plans to help end the crises the world has been facing since the emergence of the coronavirus pandemic. In Saudi Arabia, the Ministry of Health called for citizens and residents to take up the vaccine as an essential step to return life to normal. However, the take-up calls were made in the face of profound disagreements on social media platforms and online networks about the value and efficacy of the vaccines. Thus, this study seeks to explore the responses of Saudi citizens to the COVID-19 vaccines and their sentiments about being vaccinated using opinion mining methods to analyze data extracted from Twitter, the most widely used social media network in Saudi Arabia. A corpus of 37,467 tweets was built. Vector space classification (VSC) methods were used to group and categorize the selected tweets based on their linguistic content, classifying the attitudes and responses of the users into three defined categories: positive, negative, and neutral. The lexical semantic properties of the posts show a prevalence of negative responses. This indicates that health departments need to ensure citizens are equipped with accurate, evidence-based information and key facts about the COVID-19 vaccines to help them make appropriate decisions when it comes to being vaccinated. Although the study is limited to the analysis of attitudes of people to the COVID-19 vaccines in Saudi Arabia, it has clear implications for the application of opinion mining using computational linguistic methods in Arabic. © 2021},

Each citation linkage between a citation and the spans of text in the reference paper is recognized according to their content similarities via various computational methods. Then the cited text span is classified to five pre-defined facets, i.e., Hypothesis, Implication, Aim, Results and Method, based on various features of lexicons and rules via Support Vector Machine and Voting Method. Finally, a summary of the reference paper from the cited text spans is generated within 250 words. hLDA (hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic model is adopted for content modeling, which provides knowledge about sentence clustering (subtopic) and word distributions (abstractiveness) for summarization. We combine hLDA knowledge with several other classical features using different weights and proportions to evaluate the sentences in the reference paper.

We identify 11 topics for the first question and 18 topics for the second. We perform regression analysis to assess how respondents’ associations relate to their carbon tax acceptability, knowledge, and sociodemographic characteristics. The results show that, compared to people accepting the carbon tax, those rejecting it show less trust in politicians, think that the rich should pay more than the poor, consider the tax to be less fair, and stress more a lack of renewable energy or low-carbon transport. Respondents accepting a carbon tax emphasize more the need to solve environmental problems and care about a just society. These insights can help policymakers to improve the design and communication of climate policy with the aim to increase its public acceptability. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Objective: To develop novel, scalable, and valid literacy profiles for identifying limited health literacy patients by harnessing natural language processing. Data Source: With respect to the linguistic content, we analyzed 283 216 secure messages sent by 6941 diabetes patients to physicians within an integrated system's electronic portal. Sociodemographic, clinical, and utilization data were obtained via questionnaire and electronic health records. Study Design: Retrospective study used natural language processing and machine learning to generate five unique “Literacy Profiles” by employing various sets of linguistic indices: Flesch-Kincaid (LP_FK); basic indices of writing complexity, including lexical diversity (LP_LD) and writing quality (LP_WQ); and advanced indices related to syntactic complexity, lexical sophistication, and diversity, modeled from self-reported (LP_SR), and expert-rated (LP_Exp) health literacy. We first determined the performance of each literacy profile relative to self-reported and expert-rated health literacy to discriminate between high and low health literacy and then assessed Literacy Profiles’ relationships with known correlates of health literacy, such as patient sociodemographics and a range of health-related outcomes, including ratings of physician communication, medication adherence, diabetes control, comorbidities, and utilization. Principal Findings: LP_SR and LP_Exp performed best in discriminating between high and low self-reported (C-statistics: 0.86 and 0.58, respectively) and expert-rated health literacy (C-statistics: 0.71 and 0.87, respectively) and were significantly associated with educational attainment, race/ethnicity, Consumer Assessment of Provider and Systems (CAHPS) scores, adherence, glycemia, comorbidities, and emergency department visits. Conclusions: Since health literacy is a potentially remediable explanatory factor in health care disparities, the development of automated health literacy indicators represents a significant accomplishment with broad clinical and population health applications. Health systems could apply literacy profiles to efficiently determine whether quality of care and outcomes vary by patient health literacy; identify at-risk populations for targeting tailored health communications and self-management support interventions; and inform clinicians to promote improvements in individual-level care. © 2020 The Authors.

The analysis is focused on metrical and semantic aspects. First, we are developing a hybrid scansion system in order to extract and analyze rhythmical or metrical patterns. The possible metrical patterns of each verse are extracted with language-based rules. Then statistical rules are used to resolve ambiguities. Second, we are applying distributional semantic models in order to, on one hand, extract semantic regularities from sonnets, and on the other hand to group together sonnets and poets according to these semantic regularities. Besides these techniques, in this position paper we will show the objectives of the project and partial results. © 2015 Association for Computational Linguistics},

Together with rapid growth of technology, knowing an individuals personality can be done automatically. Psychology researches suggest that certain personality traits have correlation with linguistic behavior. Supported by the fame of social media, predicting humans personality from their post become possible. Most existing researches have done similar approach in predicting personality from social media. However, focuses on closed vocabulary investigation with English as their language and mostly based on Big Five personality type. In this paper, we explore Twitter as data source for open vocabulary personality prediction in Indonesia. We analyze and compare three different statistical model and find correlation about which personality traits are related with linguistic behavior. As a result, Naïve Bayes classifier outperforms the other statistical model with the highest accuracy (80% for I/E and 60% for S/N, T/F, and J/P personality traits) and shows the best performance in terms of speed in classifying the users. Moreover, a simple application was developed based on the best statistical model compared before to classify an individual's personality with their Twitter username and gender as an input. In addition, the top 30 of most frequently used words per personality traits is also the result of this experiment, in which all of the experiments has been validated with a psychology expert. © 2016 IEEE.},

Furthermore, the architecture not only can support decision makers to plan for improvement, but also equip them with forecasting ability. To enhance its forecasting quality, this study goes beyond quantitative ratios and extends them to qualitative ratios (i.e., readability: the complexities of disclosure) borrowed from computational linguistics. The results indicate that a poor readability score is highly associated with bad operations. Finally, to enlarge the mechanism’s applicable fields, the study executes the genetic algorithm (GA) to extract the inherent decision logics and represents them in a human-readable manner.

	abstract = {The Technology Opportunities Analysis System (TOAS), being developed under a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) project, enables mining of text files using bibliometrics. TOAS, a software system, extracts useful information from literature abstract files, which have identified fields that repeat in each abstract record of specific databases, such as Engineering Index (ENGI), INSPEC, Business Index, U.S. Patents, and the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) Research Reports. The TOAS applies various technologies, which include natural language processing (NLP), computational linguistics (CL), fuzzy analysis, latent semantic indexing, and principle components analysis (PCA). This software system combines simple operations (i.e., listing, counting, list comparisons and sorting of search term retrieved consolidated records' field results) with complex matrix manipulations, statistical inference and artificial intelligence approaches to reveal patterns and provide insights from large amounts of information, primarily related to technology-oriented management issues. The authors apply the TOAS tool on its own root technologies, NLP and computational linguistics—two apparently synonymous terms. These terms, however, when used in a literature search of the same abstract databases, ENGI and INSPEC, provide distinctly different search results with only 10% to 25% search result abstract records overlap. This paper introduces TOAS, summarizes analyses comparing NLP and CL, and then discusses the underlying development implications. © Springer-Vertag Berlin Heidelberg 1997.},

	abstract = {Background: To facilitate informed consent, consent forms should use language below the grade eight level. Research Ethics Boards (REBs) provide consent form templates to facilitate this goal. Templates with inappropriate language could promote consent forms that participants find difficult to understand. However, a linguistic analysis of templates is lacking. Methods: We reviewed the websites of 124 REBs for their templates. These included English language medical school REBs in Australia/New Zealand (n = 23), Canada (n = 14), South Africa (n = 8), the United Kingdom (n = 34), and a geographically-stratified sample from the United States (n = 45). Template language was analyzed using Coh-Metrix linguistic software (v.3.0, Memphis, USA). We evaluated the proportion of REBs with five key linguistic outcomes at or below grade eight. Additionally, we compared quantitative readability to the REBs' own readability standards. To determine if the template's country of origin or the presence of a local REB readability standard influenced the linguistic variables, we used a MANOVA model. Results: Of the REBs who provided templates, 0/94 (0%, 95% CI = 0-3.9%) provided templates with all linguistic variables at or below the grade eight level. Relaxing the standard to a grade 12 level did not increase this proportion. Further, only 2/22 (9.1%, 95% CI = 2.5-27.8) REBs met their own readability standard. The country of origin (DF = 20,177.5, F = 1.97, p = 0.01), but not the presence of an REB-specific standard (DF = 5, 84, F = 0.73, p = 0.60), influenced the linguistic variables. Conclusions: Inappropriate language in templates is an international problem. Templates use words that are long, abstract, and unfamiliar. This could undermine the validity of participant informed consent. REBs should set a policy of screening templates with linguistic software. © 2017 Villafranca et al.

	abstract = {Language plays at least two roles in design. First, language serves as representations of ideas and concepts through linguistic behaviors that represent the structure of thought during the design process. Second, language also performs actions and creates states of affairs. Based on these two perspectives on language use in design, we apply the computational linguistics tools of latent semantic analysis and lexical chain analysis to characterize how design teams engage in concept formation as the accumulation of knowledge represented by lexicalized concepts. The accumulation is described in a data structure comprised by a set of links between elemental lexicalized concepts. The folding together of these two perspectives on language use in design with the information processing theories of the mind afforded by the computational linguistics tools applied creates a new means to evaluate concept formation in design teams. The method suggests that analysis at a linguistic level can characterize concept formation even where process-oriented critiques were limited in their ability to uncover a formal design method that could explain the phenomenon.

	abstract = {Roles are one of the most important concepts in understanding human sociocognitive behavior. During group interactions, members take on different roles within the discussion. Roles have distinct patterns of behavioral engagement (i.e., active or passive, leading or following), contribution characteristics (i.e., providing new information or echoing given material), and social orientation (i.e., individual or group). Different combinations of roles can produce characteristically different group outcomes, and thus can be either less or more productive with regard to collective goals. In online collaborative-learning environments, this can lead to better or worse learning outcomes for the individual participants. In this study, we propose and validate a novel approach for detecting emergent roles from participants’ contributions and patterns of interaction. Specifically, we developed a group communication analysis (GCA) by combining automated computational linguistic techniques with analyses of the sequential interactions of online group communication. GCA was applied to three large collaborative interaction datasets (participant N = 2,429, group N = 3,598). Cluster analyses and linear mixed-effects modeling were used to assess the validity of the GCA approach and the influence of learner roles on student and group performance. The results indicated that participants’ patterns of linguistic coordination and cohesion are representative of the roles that individuals play in collaborative discussions. More broadly, GCA provides a framework for researchers to explore the micro intra- and interpersonal patterns associated with participants’ roles and the sociocognitive processes related to successful collaboration. © 2018, Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

Instead, we introduce here a measure of how word ranks change in time and call this distribution rank diversity.We calculate this diversity for books published in six European languages since 1800, and find that it follows a universal lognormal distribution. Based on the mean and standard deviation associated with the lognormal distribution, we define three different word regimes of languages: "heads" consist of words which almost do not change their rank in time, "bodies" are words of general use, while "tails" are comprised by contextspecific words and vary their rank considerably in time. The heads and bodies reflect the size of language cores identified by linguists for basic communication. We propose a Gaussian random walk model which reproduces the rank variation of words in time and thus the diversity. Rank diversity of words can be understood as the result of random variations in rank, where the size of the variation depends on the rank itself. We find that the core size is similar for all languages studied. © 2015 Cocho et al.},

Intelligent resources organization in such systems is closely coupled to the principles of Semantic (Intelligent) Web. One of the existing widespread applications of semantic web is Electronic learning (E-learning) service which is deemed to be "Education at all stages". The prerequisite of this semantic-driven resource management and content delivery in E-learning service has been facilitated by building Ontology thus playing a key role in managing and distributing the resources semantically. Out of the several challenging issues present in the construction of ontology, the problem of anaphora resolution (resolving pronouns) has a greater impact on the expressiveness of the constructed ontology. Anaphora resolution in the web documents with highly related sentences has obtained greater importance in the research area of semantic web. The crux contribution of the paper is to present a framework known as DEKA for constructing and visualizing ontology for the web documents based on Computational Linguistics (rule-based model). The paper also addresses the working of some of the automatic ontology construction methodologies. The experimental data sets taken from the web corpus have been found to produce promising results for the performance metrics. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {The question of how to evaluate creativity in the context of creative writing has been a subject of ongoing discussion. A key question is whether something as elusive as creativity can be evaluated in a systematic way that goes beyond subjective judgments. To answer this question, we tested whether human evaluations of the creativity of short stories can be predicted by: (1) established measures of creativity and (2) computerized linguistic analyses of the stories. We conducted two studies, in which college students (with and without interest and experience in creative writing) wrote short stories based on a writing prompt. Independent raters (six in Study 1, five in Study 2) assessed the stories using an evaluation rubric specifically designed to assess aspects of creativity, on which they showed high interrater reliability. We provide evidence of convergent validity, in that the rubric evaluations correlated with established creativity measures, including measures of divergent thinking, associative fluency, and self-reported creative behavior and achievements. Linguistic properties of the short stories were analyzed with two computerized text analysis tools: Coh-Metrix, which analyzes aspects of text cohesion and readability, and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, which identifies meaningful psychological categories of the text content. Linguistic features predicted the human ratings of creativity to a significant degree. These results provide novel evidence that creative writing can be evaluated reliably and in a systematic way that captures objective features of the text. The results further establish our evaluation rubric as a useful tool to assess creative writing. © 2018, Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

We suggest a theory of the different types of academic collaboration, and use topic models to computationally identify these in Computational Linguistics literature. A set of author-specific topics are learnt over the ACL corpus, which ranges from 1965 to 2009. The models are trained on a per year basis, whereby only papers published up until a given year are used to learn that year's author topics. To determine the collaborative properties of papers, we use, as a metric, a function of the cosine similarity score between a paper's term vector and each author's topic signature in the year preceding the paper's publication. We apply this metric to examine questions on the nature of collaborations in Computational Linguistics research, finding that significant variations exist in the way people collaborate within different subfields. © 2011 Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

That was followed by a revival of 1950s-style empiricism—AI as applied statistics—which in turn was followed by the age of deep nets. There are signs that the climate is changing again, and we offer some thoughts about paths forward, especially for younger researchers who will soon be the leaders. © Copyright © 2021 Church and Liberman.},

Here, we argue that there is a need for modeling work in this domain to explicitly take into account the richer human embodiment even for concrete concepts that prima facie relate merely to simple actions, and illustrate this using distributional methods from computational linguistics which allow us to investigate grounding of concepts based on their actual usage. We also argue that these techniques have applications in theories and models of grounding, particularly in machine implementations thereof. Similarly, considering the grounding of concepts in human terms may be of benefit to future work in computational linguistics, in particular in going beyond "grounding" concepts in the textual modality alone.

This problem arises if all known measuring procedures for a quantity of a theory presuppose the validity of this very theory, because then statements containing theoretical terms are circular. We argue that a similar circularity can happen in empirical computational linguistics, especially in cases where data are manually annotated by experts. We define a criterion of T-non-theoretical grounding as guidance to avoid such circularities, and exemplify how this criterion can be met by crowdsourcing, by task-related data annotation, or by data in the wild. We argue that this criterion should be considered as a necessary condition for an empirical science, in addition to measures for reliability of data annotation. © 2014 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

	abstract = {Generative semantic verbal fluency (SVF) tests show early and disproportionate decline relative to other abilities in individuals developing Alzheimer's disease. Optimal performance on SVF tests depends on the efficiency of using clustered organization of semantically related items and the ability to switch between clusters. Traditional approaches to clustering and switching have relied on manual determination of clusters. We evaluated a novel automated computational linguistic approach for quantifying clustering behavior. Our approach is based on Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) for computing strength of semantic relatedness between pairs of words produced in response to SVF test. The mean size of semantic clusters (MCS) and semantic chains (MChS) are calculated based on pairwise relatedness values between words. We evaluated the predictive validity of these measures on a set of 239 participants in the Nun Study, a longitudinal study of aging. All were cognitively intact at baseline assessment, measured with the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) battery, and were followed in 18-month waves for up to 20 years. The onset of either dementia or memory impairment were used as outcomes in Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age and education and censored at follow-up waves 5 (6.3 years) and 13 (16.96 years). Higher MCS was associated with 38% reduction in dementia risk at wave 5 and 26% reduction at wave 13, but not with the onset of memory impairment. Higher [+1 standard deviation (SD)] MChS was associated with 39% dementia risk reduction at wave 5 but not wave 13, and association with memory impairment was not significant. Higher traditional SVF scores were associated with 22-29% memory impairment and 35-40% dementia risk reduction. SVF scores were not correlated with either MCS or MChS. Our study suggests that an automated approach to measuring clustering behavior can be used to estimate dementia risk in cognitively normal individuals. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background. A great challenge in sharing data across information systems in general practice is the lack of interoperability between different terminologies or coding schema used in the information systems. Mapping of medical vocabularies to a standardised terminology is needed to solve data interoperability problems. Methods. We present a system to automatically map an interface terminology ICPC-2 PLUS to SNOMED CT. Three steps of mapping are proposed in this system. The UMLS metathesaurus mapping utilises explicit relationships between ICPC-2 PLUS and SNOMED CT terms in the UMLS library to perform the first stage of the mapping. Computational linguistic mapping uses natural language processing techniques and lexical similarities for the second stage of mapping between terminologies. Finally, the post-coordination mapping allows one ICPC-2 PLUS term to be mapped into an aggregation of two or more SNOMED CT terms. Results. A total 5,971 of all 7,410 ICPC-2 terms (80.58%) were mapped to SNOMED CT using the three stages but with different levels of accuracy. UMLS mapping achieved the mapping of 53.0% ICPC2 PLUS terms to SNOMED CT with the precision rate of 96.46% and overall recall rate of 44.89%. Lexical mapping increased the result to 60.31% and post-coordination mapping gave an increase of 20.27% in mapped terms. A manual review of a part of the mapping shows that the precision of lexical mappings is around 90%. The accuracy of post-coordination has not been evaluated yet. Unmapped terms and mismatched terms are due to the differences in the structures between ICPC-2 PLUS and SNOMED CT. Terms contained in ICPC-2 PLUS but not in SNOMED CT caused a large proportion of the failures in the mappings. Conclusion. Mapping terminologies to a standard vocabulary is a way to facilitate consistent medical data exchange and achieve system interoperability and data standardisation. Broad scale mapping cannot be achieved by any single method and methods based on computational linguistics can be very useful for the task. Automating as much as is possible of this process turns the searching and mapping task into a validation task, which can effectively reduce the cost and increase the efficiency and accuracy of this task over manual methods. © 2008 Wang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Text mining is rapidly becoming an essential technique for the annotation and analysis of large biological data sets. Biomedical literature currently increases at a rate of several thousand papers per week, making automated information retrieval methods the only feasible method of managing this expanding corpus. With the increasing prevalence of open-access journals and constant growth of publicly-available repositories of biomedical literature, literature mining has become much more effective with respect to the extraction of biomedically-relevant data. In recent years, text mining of popular databases such as MEDLINE has evolved from basic term-searches to more sophisticated natural language processing techniques, indexing and retrieval methods, structural analysis and integration of literature with associated metadata. In this review, we will focus on Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), a computational linguistics technique increasingly used for a variety of biological purposes. It is noted for its ability to consistently outperform benchmark Boolean text searches and co-occurrence models at information retrieval and its power to extract indirect relationships within a data set. LSI has been used successfully to formulate new hypotheses, generate novel connections from existing data, and validate empirical data. © 2013 Chen, Martin, Daimon and Maudsley.},

Its primary purpose is to serve as a reference repository of research results, but we believe that it can also be an object of study and a platform for research in its own right. We describe an enriched and standardized reference corpus derived from the ACL Anthology that can be used for research in scholarly document processing. This corpus, which we call the ACL Anthology Reference Corpus (ACL ARC), brings together the recent activities of a number of research groups around the world. Our goal is to make the corpus widely available, and to encourage other researchers to use it as a standard testbed for experiments in both bibliographic and bibliometric research.},

Despite these serious consequences and the wealth of available data, dehumanization has not yet been computationally studied on a large scale. Drawing upon social psychology research, we create a computational linguistic framework for analyzing dehumanizing language by identifying linguistic correlates of salient components of dehumanization. We then apply this framework to analyze discussions of LGBTQ people in the New York Times from 1986 to 2015. Overall, we find increasingly humanizing descriptions of LGBTQ people over time. However, we find that the label homosexual has emerged to be much more strongly associated with dehumanizing attitudes than other labels, such as gay. Our proposed techniques highlight processes of linguistic variation and change in discourses surrounding marginalized groups. Furthermore, the ability to analyze dehumanizing language at a large scale has implications for automatically detecting and understanding media bias as well as abusive language online. © Copyright © 2020 Mendelsohn, Tsvetkov and Jurafsky.},

	abstract = {In recent years, many studies on computational linguistics have employed the Web as source for research. Specifically, the distribution of textual data in the Web is used to drive linguistic analyses in tasks such as information extraction, knowledge acquisition or natural language processing. For these purposes, commercial Web search engines are commonly used as the low-entry-cost way to access Web data and, more specifically, to estimate the distribution of the entity(ies) of interest from the hit count the search engines provide when querying such entities. Even though several studies have evaluated the effectiveness of Web search engines as information retrieval tools from the perspective of the end users, few authors have assessed the suitability of hit counts as research tools in computational linguistics; moreover, studies so far have focused on the most well-known search engines (typically Google, Bing and Yahoo!), and neglected potentially interesting alternatives that have recently surfaced. To fill this gap, in this work, we first compile and survey the general-purpose search engines that are currently available. Then, we evaluate the suitability of the hit counts they provide under several perspectives that are relevant for computational linguistics: flexibility of the query language, linguistic coherence, mathematical coherence and temporal consistency. The results of our survey show that, even though the choice of a particular search engine has been generally ignored by researchers relying on Web data, there are significant quality differences between the hit counts of current search engines, and that the most well-known and widely-used search engines do not provide the best results. In this respect, we also identify the search engines whose hit counts are best suited for research. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In this article we describe the emerging area of text classification research focused on the problem of collaborative learning process analysis both from a broad perspective and more specifically in terms of a publicly available tool set called TagHelper tools. Analyzing the variety of pedagogically valuable facets of learners' interactions is a time consuming and effortful process. Improving automated analyses of such highly valued processes of collaborative learning by adapting and applying recent text classification technologies would make it a less arduous task to obtain insights from corpus data. This endeavor also holds the potential for enabling substantially improved on-line instruction both by providing teachers and facilitators with reports about the groups they are moderating and by triggering context sensitive collaborative learning support on an as-needed basis. In this article, we report on an interdisciplinary research project, which has been investigating the effectiveness of applying text classification technology to a large CSCL corpus that has been analyzed by human coders using a theory-based multi-dimensional coding scheme. We report promising results and include an in-depth discussion of important issues such as reliability, validity, and efficiency that should be considered when deciding on the appropriateness of adopting a new technology such as TagHelper tools. One major technical contribution of this work is a demonstration that an important piece of the work towards making text classification technology effective for this purpose is designing and building linguistic pattern detectors, otherwise known as features, that can be extracted reliably from texts and that have high predictive power for the categories of discourse actions that the CSCL community is interested in. © 2008 International Society of the Learning Sciences, Inc.; Springer Science+ Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Religious violence is one of the biggest and most complicated problems facing the world today. The number of incidents has been increasing in recent years and, unfortunately, scalable and accurate systems to predict which groups are likely to engage in such actions are not keeping pace. Additionally, this problem is compounded by lingual and cultural differences, which limit the effectiveness of understanding how tolerant or intolerant a group is without bias. To circumvent this challenge, recent studies indicate promise in the analysis of the performative character of discourse (how words are used) to estimate the tolerance level, rather than using the semantic or emotive character of text (what the words mean or imply). Using expert estimates of linguistic flexibility, a representation of the performative character of text, and thus also predictive of a text's tolerance level, this paper describes (a) new approaches to automating the quantification of the performative character of words and (b) the predictive efficacy of these approaches versus traditional semantic indicators of tolerance or intolerance. To implement the pipeline, a judgment identifier was developed along with multiple semantic density algorithms to extract the frequency of judgments and flexibility of keyword contexts, respectively. Test results show that text mining algorithms can accurately estimate the language flexibility of religious discourse. These results provide evidence that the performative characteristics of language better predict tolerance level than the semantic characteristics of language. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Introduction: A central feature of schizophrenia is the disorganization and impoverishment of language. Recently, we observed higher semantic similarity in first-episode-schizophrenia (FES) patients. In this study, we investigate if this aberrant similarity relates to the ‘causal’ connectivity between two key nodes of the word production system: inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the semantic-hub at the ventral anterior temporal lobe (vATL). Methods: Resting-state fMRI scans were collected from 60 participants (30 untreated FES and 30 healthy controls). The semantic distance was measured with the CoVec semantic tool based on GloVe. A spectral dynamic causal model with Parametrical Empirical Bayes was constructed modelling the intrinsic self-inhibitory and extrinsic-excitatory connections within the brain regions. We estimated the parameters of a fully connected model with the semantic distance as a covariate. Results: FES patients chose words with higher semantic similarity when describing the pictures compared to the HC group. Among patients, an increased semantic similarity was related with an increase in intrinsic connections within both the vATL and IFG, suggesting that reduced ‘synaptic gain’ in these regions likely contribute to aberrant sampling of the semantic space during discourse in schizophrenia. Conclusions: Lexical impoverishment relates to increased self-inhibition in both the IFG and vATL. The associated reduction in synaptic gain may relate to reduced precision of locally generated neural activity, forcing the choice of words that are already ‘activated’ in a lexical network. One approach to improve word sampling may be via promoting synaptic gain via supra-physiological stimulation within the Broca's-vATL network; this proposal needs verification. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

This paper introduces a new resource to support researchers from different interdisciplinary areas such as computational linguistics, descriptive translation studies, computer-aided translation technology, Arabic machine translation applications, cognitive science, and translation pedagogy. Motivated by the lack of learner translator resources that provide data about learners of translation from and into Arabic, the undergraduate learner translator corpus (ULTC) is an ongoing, error-tagged sentence-aligned parallel corpus of English, Arabic, and French, with Arabic as its main language. The present corpus, consisting of parallel texts of female learners of translation from English or French into Arabic, is the first of its kind in terms of the languages represented, tasks covered, and number of students involved. It is also unique in terms of combining many complementary corpora of cross-lingual data, each of which has its own web-based query interface and corpus analysis tools. This paper describes the ULTC compilation process, preliminary findings, and planned future expansion and research. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

This proof-of-concept study shows that CoVec, a new automated tool, is able to differentiate between controls and patients with schizophrenia with derailment and tangentiality. According to ratings from the derailment and tangentiality items of the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms, we divided the sample into three groups: controls, patients without formal thought disorder, and patients with derailment/tangentiality. Their lists of animals produced during a one-minute semantic fluency task were processed using CoVec, a newly developed software that measures the semantic similarity of words based on vector semantic analysis. CoVec outputs were Mean Similarity, Coherence, Coherence-5, and Coherence-10. Patients with schizophrenia produced fewer words than controls. Patients with derailment had a significantly lower mean number of words and lower Coherence-5 than controls and patients without derailment. Patients with tangentiality had significantly lower Coherence-5 and Coherence-10 than controls and patients without tangentiality. Despite the small samples of patients with clinically apparent thought disorder, CoVec was able to detect subtle differences between controls and patients with either or both of the two forms of disorganization. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Human rights discourse has been likened to a global lingua franca, and in more ways than one, the analogy seems apt. Human rights discourse is a language that is used by all yet belongs uniquely to no particular place. It crosses not only the borders between nation-states, but also the divide between national law and international law: It appears in national constitutions and international treaties alike. But is it possible to conceive of human rights as a global language or lingua franca not just in a figurative or metaphorical sense, but in a literal or linguistic sense as a legal dialect defined by distinctive patterns of word choice and usage? Does there exist a global language of human rights that transcends not only national borders, but also the divide between domestic and international law? Empirical analysis suggests that the answer is yes, but this global language comes in at least two variants or dialects. New techniques for performing automated content analysis enable us to analyze the bulk of all national constitutions over the last two centuries, together with the world's leading regional and international human rights instruments, for patterns of linguistic similarity and to evaluate how much language, if any, they share in common. Specifically, we employ a technique known as topic modeling that disassembles texts into recurring verbal patterns. The results highlight the existence of two species or dialects of rights talk-the universalist dialect and the positive-rights dialect-both of which are global in reach and rising in popularity. The universalist dialect is generic in content and draws heavily on the type of language found in international and regional human rights instruments. It appears in particularly large doses in the constitutions of transitional states, developing states, and states that have been heavily exposed to the influence of the international community. The positive-rights dialect, by contrast, is characterized by its substantive emphasis on positive rights of a social or economic variety, and by its prevalence in lengthier constitutions and constitutions from outside the common law world, especially those of the Spanish-speaking world. Both dialects of rights talk are truly transnational, in the sense that they appear simultaneously in national, regional, and international legal instruments and transcend the distinction between domestic and international law. Their existence attests to the blurring of the boundary between constitutional law and international law. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

	abstract = {Careful fidelity monitoring and feedback are critical to implementing effective interventions. A wide range of procedures exist to assess fidelity; most are derived from observational assessments (Schoenwald and Garland, Psycholog Assess 25:146–156, 2013). However, these fidelity measures are resource intensive for research teams in efficacy/effectiveness trials, and are often unattainable or unmanageable for the host organization to rate when the program is implemented on a large scale. We present a first step towards automated processing of linguistic patterns in fidelity monitoring of a behavioral intervention using an innovative mixed methods approach to fidelity assessment that uses rule-based, computational linguistics to overcome major resource burdens. Data come from an effectiveness trial of the Familias Unidas intervention, an evidence-based, family-centered preventive intervention found to be efficacious in reducing conduct problems, substance use and HIV sexual risk behaviors among Hispanic youth. This computational approach focuses on “joining,” which measures the quality of the working alliance of the facilitator with the family. Quantitative assessments of reliability are provided. Kappa scores between a human rater and a machine rater for the new method for measuring joining reached 0.83. Early findings suggest that this approach can reduce the high cost of fidelity measurement and the time delay between fidelity assessment and feedback to facilitators; it also has the potential for improving the quality of intervention fidelity ratings. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Unlike homopolymers, biopolymers are composed of specific sequences of different types of monomers. In proteins and RNA molecules, one-dimensional sequence information encodes a three-dimensional fold, leading to a corresponding molecular function. Such folded structures are not treated adequately through traditional methods of polymer statistical mechanics. A promising new way to solve problems of the statistical mechanics of biomolecules comes from computational linguistics, the field that uses computers to parse and understand the sentences in natural languages. Here, we give two examples. First, we show that a dynamic programming method of computational linguistics gives a fast way to search protein models for native structures. Interestingly, the computational search process closely resembles the physical folding process. Second, linguistics-based dynamic programming methods are also useful for computing partition functions and densities of states for some foldable biopolymers - helix-bundle proteins are reviewed here.

	abstract = {Extraction of Emotions from Multilingual Text posted on social media by different categories of users is one of the crucial tasks in the field of opining mining and sentiment analysis. Every major event in the world has an online presence and social media. Users use social media platforms to express their sentiments and opinions towards it. In this paper, an advanced framework for detection of emotions of users in Multilanguage text data using emotion theories has been presented, which deals with linguistics and psychology. The emotion extraction system is developed based on multiple features groups for the better understanding of emotion lexicons. Empirical studies of three real-time events in domains like a Political election, healthcare, and sports are performed using proposed framework. The technique used for dynamic keywords collection is based on RSS (Rich Site Summary) feeds of headlines of news articles and trending hashtags from Twitter. An intelligent data collection model has been developed using dynamic keywords. Every word of emotion contained in a tweet is important in decision making and hence to retain the importance of multilingual emotional words, effective pre-processing technique has been used. Naive Bayes algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used for fine-grained emotions classification of tweets. Experiments conducted on collected data sets, show that the proposed method performs better in comparison to corpus-driven approach which assign affective orientation or scores to words. The proposed emotion extraction framework performs better on the collected dataset by combining feature sets consisting of words from publicly available lexical resources. Furthermore, the presented work for extraction of emotion from tweets performs better in comparisons of other popular sentiment analysis techniques which are dependent of specific existing affect lexicons. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {It is important to help researchers find valuable papers from a large literature collection. To this end, many graph-based ranking algorithms have been proposed. However, most of these algorithms suffer from the problem of ranking bias. Ranking bias hurts the usefulness of a ranking algorithm because it returns a ranking list with an undesirable time distribution. This paper is a focused study on how to alleviate ranking bias by leveraging the heterogeneous network structure of the literature collection. We propose a new graph-based ranking algorithm, MutualRank, that integrates mutual reinforcement relationships among networks of papers, researchers, and venues to achieve a more synthetic, accurate, and less-biased ranking than previous methods. MutualRank provides a unified model that involves both intra- and inter-network information for ranking papers, researchers, and venues simultaneously. We use the ACL Anthology Network as the benchmark data set and construct the gold standard from computer linguistics course websites of well-known universities and two well-known textbooks. The experimental results show that MutualRank greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors, including PageRank, HITS, CoRank, Future Rank, and P-Rank, in ranking papers in both improving ranking effectiveness and alleviating ranking bias. Rankings of researchers and venues by MutualRank are also quite reasonable. © 2015 ASIS&T},

This paper examines the crime domain in the Arabic language (unstructured text) using text mining techniques. The development and application of a Crime Profiling System (CPS) is presented. The system is able to extract meaningful information, in this case the type of crime, location and nationality, from Arabic language crime news reports. The system has two unique attributes; firstly, information extraction that depends on local grammar, and secondly, dictionaries that can be automatically generated. It is shown that the CPS improves the quality of the data through reduction where only meaningful information is retained. Moreover, the Self Organising Map (SOM) approach is adopted in order to perform the clustering of the crime reports, based on crime type. This clustering technique is improved because only refined data containing meaningful keywords extracted through the information extraction process are inputted into it, i.e. the data are cleansed by removing noise. The proposed system is validated through experiments using a corpus collated from different sources; it was not used during system development. Precision, recall and F-measure are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed information extraction approach. Also, comparisons are conducted with other systems. In order to evaluate the clustering performance, three parameters are used: data size, loading time and quantization error. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Language deficits are prevalent in psychotic illness, including its risk states, and are related to marked impairment in functioning. It is therefore important to characterize language impairment in the psychosis spectrum in order to develop potential preventive interventions. Natural language processing (NLP) metrics of semantic coherence and syntactic complexity have been used to discriminate schizophrenia patients from healthy controls (HC) and predict psychosis onset in individuals at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis. To date, no studies have yet examined the construct validity of key NLP features with respect to clinical ratings of thought disorder in a CHR cohort. Herein we test the association of key NLP metrics of coherence and complexity with ratings of positive and negative thought disorder, respectively, in 60 CHR individuals, using Andreasen's Scale of Assessment of Thought, Language and Communication (TLC) Scale to measure of positive and negative thought disorder. As hypothesized, in CHR individuals, the NLP metric of semantic coherence was significantly correlated with positive thought disorder severity and the NLP metrics of complexity (sentence length and determiner use) were correlated with negative thought disorder severity. The finding of construct validity supports the premise that NLP analytics, at least in respect to core features of reduction of coherence and complexity, are capturing clinically relevant language disturbances in risk states for psychosis. Further psychometric study is required, in respect to reliability and other forms of validity. © 2021},

By comparing adjacent versions of the same article, we extract voluminous training data for tasks for which data is usually scarce or costly to obtain. We illustrate this paradigm by applying it to three separate text processing tasks at various levels of linguistic granularity. We first apply this approach to the collection of textual errors and their correction, focusing on the specific type of lexical errors known as "eggcorns". Second, moving up to the sentential level, we show how to mine Wikipedia revisions for training sentence compression algorithms. By dramatically increasing the size of the available training data, we are able to create more discerning lexicalized models, providing improved compression results. Finally, moving up to the document level, we present some preliminary ideas on how to use the Wikipedia data to bootstrap text summarization systems. We propose to use a sentence's persistence throughout a document's evolution as an indicator of its fitness as part of an extractive summary. Copyright © 2008.},

	abstract = {—Computational linguistics is concerned with understanding language from a computational perspective and constructing artifacts that are useful in processing and generating language. In the use of language, whether human language or programming language, there can be an error that makes the language not understood properly. One of the errors that often occurs is syntax error. In language, a syntax error is a mistake in using a language that involves organizing words and phrases that do not make sense. While in programming, a syntax error is an error in writing code in a program that makes the format or information unrecognizable by the computer system. Such errors are the simplest of errors but can affect many aspects of the final code output. This article aims to show how writing errors or typos in programming code can affect some or all of the results. The data obtained is data from web programming code that is used to make the website display the Geographic Information System Clustering the Distribution of Stunting Disease in Banggai Regency with K-Means, and also the R programming code used to calculate the stunting distribution using K-Means. The results of this article will show that a typo, even just a letter or any single punctuation, can affect the program’s final result. © 2022 ACADEMY PUBLICATION.},

Semantic domains allow us to exploit domain features for texts, terms and concepts, and they can significantly boost the performance of natural-language processing systems. Semantic domains can be derived from existing lexical resources or can be acquired from corpora in an unsupervised manner. They also have the property of interlinguality, and they can be used to relate terms in different languages in multilingual application scenarios. The authors give a comprehensive explanation of the computational model, with detailed chapters on semantic domains, domain models, and applications of the technique in text categorization, word sense disambiguation, and cross-language text categorization.

	abstract = {The quality of requirements is fundamental in engineering projects. Requirements are usually expressed partly or totally in a natural language (NL) format and come from different documents. Their qualities are difficult to analyze manually, especially when hundreds of thousands of them have to be considered. The assistance of software tools is becoming a necessity. In this article, the goal was to develop a set of metrics supported by NL processing (NLP) methods supporting different types of analysis of requirements and especially the dependencies between requirements. An NLP approach is used to extract requirements from text; to analyze their quality, links, similarities, and contradictions; and to cluster them automatically. The analysis framework includes different combinations of methods such as cosine similarity, singular value decomposition, and K-means clustering. One objective is to assess the possible combinations and their impacts on detections to establish optimal metrics. Three case studies exemplify and support the validation of the work. Graphs are used to represent the automatically clustered requirements, as well as similarities and contradictions. A new contradiction analysis process that includes a rules-based approach is proposed. Finally, the combined results are presented as graphs, which unveil the semantic relationships between requirements. Subsection 4.8 compares the results provided by the tool and the results obtained from experts. The proposed methodology and network presentation not only support the understanding of the semantics of the requirements but also help requirements engineers to review the interconnections and consistency of requirements systems and manage traceability. The approach is valuable during the early phases of projects when requirements are evolving dynamically and rapidly. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Providing a broad, accessible treatment of the theory as well as linguistic applications, Semisupervised Learning for Computational Linguistics offers self-contained coverage of semisupervised methods that includes background material on supervised and unsupervised learning. The book presents a brief history of semisupervised learning and its place in the spectrum of learning methods before moving on to discuss well-known natural language processing methods, such as self-training and co-training. It then centers on machine learning techniques, including the boundary-oriented methods of perceptrons, boosting, support vector machines (SVMs), and the null-category noise model. In addition, the book covers clustering, the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, related generative methods, and agreement methods. It concludes with the graph-based method of label propagation as well as a detailed discussion of spectral methods. Taking an intuitive approach to the material, this lucid book facilitates the application of semisupervised learning methods to natural language processing and provides the framework and motivation for a more systematic study of machine learning. © 2008 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The use of linguistic summaries provides tools for the verbalisation of data analysis (mining) results which, in addition to the more commonly used visualisation, e.g. via a graphical user interface, can contribute to an increased human consistency and ease of use, notably for supporting decision makers via the data-driven decision support system paradigm. Two new relevant aspects of the analysis are also outlined which were first initiated by the authors. First, following Kacprzyk and Zadrozny, it is further considered how linguistic data summarisation is closely related to some types of solutions used in natural language generation (NLG). This can make it possible to use more and more effective and efficient tools and techniques developed in NLG. Second, similar remarks are given on relations to systemic functional linguistics. Moreover, following Kacprzyk and Zadrozny, comments are given on an extremely relevant aspect of scalability of linguistic summarisation of data, using a new concept of a conceptual scalability. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {This article provides an extensive overview of the literature related to the phenomenon of non-nominal-antecedent anaphora (also known as abstract anaphora or discourse deixis), a type of anaphora in which an anaphor like “that” refers to an antecedent (marked in boldface) that is syntactically non-nominal, such as the first sentence in “It’s way too hot here. That’s why I’m moving to Alaska.” Annotating and automatically resolving these cases of anaphora is interesting in its own right because of the complexities involved in identifying non-nominal antecedents, which typically represent abstract objects such as events, facts, and propositions. There is also practical value in the resolution of non-nominal-antecedent anaphora, as this would help computational systems in machine translation, summarization, and question answering, as well as, conceivably, any other task dependent on some measure of text understanding. Most of the existing approaches to anaphora annotation and resolution focus on nominal-antecedent anaphora, classifying many of the cases where the antecedents are syntactically non-nominal as non-anaphoric. There has been some work done on this topic, but it remains scattered and difficult to collect and assess. With this article, we hope to bring together and synthesize work done in disparate contexts up to now in order to identify fundamental problems and draw conclusions from an overarching perspective. Having a good picture of the current state of the art in this field can help researchers direct their efforts to where they are most necessary. Because of the great variety of theoretical approaches that have been brought to bear on the problem, there is an equally diverse array of terminologies that are used to describe it, so we will provide an overview and discussion of these terminologies. We also describe the linguistic properties of non-nominal-antecedent anaphora, examine previous annotation efforts that have addressed this topic, and present the computational approaches that aim at resolving non-nominal-antecedent anaphora automatically. We close with a review of the remaining open questions in this area and some of our recommendations for future research. © 2018 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

However, this also makes the survivors vulnerable to bullying, trolling and victim blaming. Specifically, victim blaming has been shown to have acute psychological effects on the survivors and further discourage formal reporting of such crimes. Therefore, it is important to devise computationally relevant methods to identify and prevent victim blaming to protect the victims. In our work, we discuss the drastic effects of victim blaming through a short case study and then propose a single step transfer-learning based classification method to identify victim blaming language on Twitter. Finally, we compare the performance of our proposed model against various deep learning and machine learning models on a manually annotated domain-specific dataset. © 2020 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

	abstract = {One of the research domains in the field of sentiment analysis is automatic emotion recognition in texts which is a worthy topic in human-computer interaction. Text processing has always faced many challenges. The main one is the structural and semantic differences of sentences which have had a significant impact on the malfunction of auto-recognition systems. This problem becomes more prominent in short texts in which words and their concurrences are limited and insufficient. As a result of this, word frequency and TF-IDF weighing cannot well represent the relationship between words and the appropriate feature vector, leading to an undesirable accuracy of emotion recognition. Thus, different strategies should be applied to improve the feature vector and to formulate the features properly. The desired strategy should be able to identify the words that can distinguish between classes well and also to find the relationships between words and meaningful phrases using natural language processing concepts. In this paper, a combination of emotional models, categorical and hierarchical, are used for an emotional text recognition which could discover simultaneously explicit and implicit emotion in a short text. Our approach called DuFER, proposed a weighed method which improves the feature vector using language models and computational linguistics through applying a modified TF-IDF weighing to words as well as Maximum Likelihood Estimation weighing to expressions. Four implicit and explicit emotion datasets are used for the experiments. The results show that the accuracy of both implicit and explicit emotion recognition has increased and DuFER is actually the first successful dual framework in recognizing implicit and explicit emotions from text. © 2022},

	abstract = {Background: Many countries are developing or reviewing national adaptation policy for climate change but the extent to which these meet the health needs of vulnerable groups has not been assessed. This study examines the adequacy of such policies for nine known climate-vulnerable groups: people with mental health conditions, Aboriginal people, culturally and linguistically diverse groups, aged people, people with disabilities, rural communities, children, women, and socioeconomically disadvantaged people. Methods: The study analyses an exhaustive sample of national adaptation policy documents from Annex 1 ('developed') countries of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change: 20 documents from 12 countries. A 'critical computational linguistics' method was used involving novel software-driven quantitative mapping and traditional critical discourse analysis. Results: The study finds that references to vulnerable groups are relatively little present or non-existent, as well as poorly connected to language about practical strategies and socio-economic contexts, both also little present. Conclusions: The conclusions offer strategies for developing policy that is better informed by a 'social determinants of health' definition of climate vulnerability, consistent with best practice in the literature and global policy prescriptions. © 2014 Seidel and Bell; licensee BioMed Central.},

	abstract = {Obtaining informed consent (IC) is an ethical imperative, signifying participants’ understanding of the conditions and implications of research participation. One setting where the stakes for understanding are high is randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which test the effectiveness and safety of medical interventions. However, the use of legalese and medicalese in ethical forms coupled with the need to explain RCT-related concepts (e.g. randomization) can increase patients’ cognitive load when reading text. There is a need to systematically examine the language demands of IC documents, including whether the processes intended to safeguard patients by providing clear information might do the opposite through complex, inaccessible language. Therefore, the goal of this study is to build an open-access corpus of patient information sheets (PIS) and consent forms (CF) and analyze each genre using an interdisciplinary approach to capture multidimensional measures of language quality beyond traditional readability measures. A search of publicly-available online IC documents for UK-based cancer RCTs (2000-17) yielded corpora of 27 PIS and 23 CF. Textual analysis using the computational tool, Coh-Metrix, revealed different linguistic dimensions relating to the complexity of IC documents, particularly low word concreteness for PIS and low referential and deep cohesion for CF, although both had high narrativity. Key part-of-speech analyses using Wmatrix corpus software revealed a contrast between the overrepresentation of the pronoun ‘you’ plus modal verbs in PIS and ‘I’ in CF, exposing the contradiction inherent in conveying uncertainty to patients using tentative language in PIS while making them affirm certainty in their understanding in CF. © The Author(s) 2020.},

In this respect, TGermaCorp contributes to establishing characterising features for resource descriptions, which is needed for keeping track of a meaningful comparison of the ever-growing number of natural language resources.

We conduct such a literature review on 1307 articles published in the journal Economy of Regions from 2010 to 2021 using advanced topic modelling techniques. This analysis aims to describe the main research areas in the journal over time, the dynamics of their popularity and the relationship with key quantitative indicators. We identified 22 topics ranging from“Agriculture” and“Economic Geography” to“Fiscal Policy” and“Entrepreneurship”. We estimate how popularity of these topics was changing over time and find topics that gained the most popularity from 2010 to 2021 (+17.61 %,“Spatial Economics”) or lost it (-14.58 %,“Economics of Innovation”). The topic of environmental economics collects the largest number of citations per article (3.64, on average), and the topics on monetary policy and poverty are the most popular among manuscripts in English, which is also true for articles written by authors with foreign affiliation. Papers with third-party funding are concentrated the most in “Spatial Economics” (around 11 %), and the least — in “Agriculture”. Our results can help to understand the evolution in scope of research of Economy of Regions and serve researchers to find promising directions for future studies. © Savin, I. V., Teplyakov, N. S.

	abstract = {Cross-cultural interactions within the design team (and/or with external participants, as in co-design processes) can impact the team in many ways. In modeling changes in design processes over time, it is important to capture changes in key aspects of design processes, such as understanding of the problem and emergence of crucial new ideas. However, modeling such foundational change can be very effort-intensive for researchers. In this short paper, we explore the use of computational linguistic methods – such as topic modeling – as a cost-effective supplement to traditional methods in providing a “quick and dirty” birds-eye view of what designers are talking about, and how those topics change over time. Specifically, we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation – a foundational topic model approach – to explore changes in the diversity and prominence of topics over time in the DTRS11 dataset. We test the impacts of variations in key modeling assumptions and parameters on the quality of the resulting model. Overall, our topic models identify a robust shift in diversity of topics following the second co-creation session. We also find significant changes (both decreases and increases) in the prominence of several topics. These high-level patterns provide a quantitative complement to qualitative intuitions, and raise interesting new research questions (e.g., did the design team learn more from the second co-creation session compared to the first? If so, what changed?). In summary, our analysis demonstrates the benefits and potential limitations of computational linguistic methods as a supplement to traditional in-depth qualitative analysis of design processes. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London, UK.},

It applies computational linguistics to interpret large format public consultation by identifying shared interests and desired qualities for urban infrastructure services and utilities. As a proof of concept, data was used from the Christchurch public engagement initiative called ‘Share an Idea,’ where public thoughts, ideas, and opinions were expressed about the future redevelopment of Christchurch after the 2011 earthquakes. The data set was analysed to identify shared interests and desired connections between institutional, communal, or personal infrastructures with the physical urban infrastructures in terms of buildings, public places, and utilities. The data has been visualised using chord charts from the D3 JavaScript open source library to illustrate the existence of connections between soft and hard urban infrastructures along with individual contributions or stories. Lastly, the analysis was used to create an infographic design brief that compares and contrasts qualitative information from public consultation with quantitative municipal statistical data on well-being. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).},

Today, UTMK's focus is on the development of natural language processing applications and tools (internet browsers, and corpus and dictionary databases). And, continuing with its policy for research collaborations, UTMK is leading a threecountry project to pool computing and linguistic resources and expertise on Malay. Due to historical reasons, bahasa Indonesia and Bahasa Melayu, the Malay used respectively in Indonesia and in Malaysia have diverged with differences in vocabulary, pronunciation and spelling. For effective communication, a council was set up in 1972 to standardize the spelling and terminology used in the two countries. Brunei joined this council in 1985. To encourage studies on Malay, texts need to be available. However, resources in digital form are wanting. At a recent meeting, the council proposed to set up a Malay language portal to make linguistic resources from the three countries available on-line, and also to popularise Malay as a South-East Asian language. The participation of non-member countries in the portal is welcomed.},

Support Vector Machine classification technology in data mining was studied to explore how to conduct effective and reliable evaluation, so as to provide a scientific basis for decision-making in improving accounting management. After the simulation experiment, it is proved that continuously improving the ethical standards of accountants and strengthening the forecast of accounting risks can continue to optimize the accounting office management. © 2018},

	abstract = {Many scholars have proposed that feeling what we believe others are feeling—often known as “empathy”—is essential for other-regarding sentiments and plays an important role in our moral lives. Caring for and about others (without necessarily sharing their feelings)—often known as “compassion”—is also frequently discussed as a relevant force for prosocial motivation and action. Here, we explore the relationship between empathy and compassion using the methods of computational linguistics. Analyses of 2,356,916 Facebook posts suggest that individuals (N =2,781) high in empathy use different language than those high in compassion, after accounting for shared variance between these constructs. Empathic people, controlling for compassion, often use self-focused language and write about negative feelings, social isolation, and feeling overwhelmed. Compassionate people, controlling for empathy, often use other-focused language and write about positive feelings and social connections. In addition, high empathy without compassion is related to negative health outcomes, while high compassion without empathy is related to positive health outcomes, positive lifestyle choices, and charitable giving. Such findings favor an approach to moral motivation that is grounded in compassion rather than empathy. © 2023 American Psychological Association},

	abstract = {Creativity, the ability to generate original and valuable products, has long been linked to semantic retrieval processes. The associative theory of creativity posits flexible retrieval ability as an important basis for creative idea generation. However, there is insufficient research on how flexible memory retrieval acts on creative activities. This study aimed to capture different dynamic aspects of retrieval processes and examine the behavioral and neural associations between retrieval flexibility and creativity. We developed 5 metrics to quantify retrieval flexibility based on previous studies, which confirmed the important role of creativity. Our findings showed that retrieval flexibility was positively correlated with multiple creativity-related behavior constructs and can promote distinct search patterns in different creative groups. Moreover, high flexibility was associated with the lifetime of a specific brain state during rest, characterized by interactions among large-scale cognitive brain systems. The flexible functional connectivity within and between default mode, executive control, and salience provides further evidence on brain dynamics of creativity. Retrieval flexibility mediated the links between the lifetime of the related brain state and creativity. This new approach is expected to enhance our knowledge of the role of retrieval flexibility in creativity from a dynamic perspective. © The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press.

	abstract = {We used a computational linguistic approach, exploiting machine learning techniques, to examine the letters written by King George III during mentally healthy and apparently mentally ill periods of his life. The aims of the study were: first, to establish the existence of alterations in the King's written language at the onset of his first manic episode; and secondly to identify salient sources of variation contributing to the changes. Effects on language were sought in two control conditions (politically stressful vs. politically tranquil periods and seasonal variation). We found clear differences in the letter corpus, across a range of different features, in association with the onset of mental derangement, which were driven by a combination of linguistic and information theory features that appeared to be specific to the contrast between acute mania and mental stability. The paucity of existing data relevant to changes in written language in the presence of acute mania suggests that lexical, syntactic and stylometric descriptions of written discourse produced by a cohort of patients with a diagnosis of acute mania will be necessary to support the diagnosis independently and to look for other periods of mental illness of the course of the King's life, and in other historically significant figures with similarly large archives of handwritten documents. © 2017 Rentoumi et al.

Major potential contributions of CL methodologies (e.g., word embeddings, interpretational frameworks) for deepening that theoretical understanding of suicide behaviors and promoting the personalized approach in psychological assessment are presented as well. We also discuss principal ethical and methodological obstacles in CL suicide prevention, such as the difficulty to maintain people’s privacy/safety or interpret the “black box” of prediction algorithms. Ethical guidelines and practical methodological recommendations addressing these obstacles are provided for future researchers and clinicians. © The Author(s) 2021.},

Within the framework of the method of goal dynamic estimating of alternatives, the level of social tension is determined as the degree of achievement of the main goal, the ratings of news publications and the ratings of news events that contributed to the increase in social tension are calculated. The study presents the efficient method of determining the level of social tension and defining the main factors that have the greatest impact on the growth of social tension. Further studies are needed to improve the estimates of factors and the overall estimate of social tension. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Novel data acquisition methods have been developed in recent years leading to large sets of translation process data that is analysed qualitatively as well as quantitatively. What has been anticipated already decades ago, today, computational linguistics methods are instrumental for translation process research and translation studies to enhance machine translation technologies by analysing real human behaviour. Empirical translation process research thus becomes more formalized and interconnected with computational linguistics methods and may potentially give answers to questions raised long time ago. In this chapter we trace the development of computational linguistics and translation process research from this angle and point to developments that we think will further drive this vibrant field of research. © 2016 John Benjamins Publishing Company},

	abstract = {With the inception of the digital age and, in particular, the widespread adoption of the Internet as a communication tool and as a medium for information exchange, the amount of information available to the public has grown exponentially, although the tools for processing and extracting meaning from this enormous body of information have only grown linearly. To address these pressing needs, computational linguists have developed three main approaches to natural language processing (NLP): the statistical approach; the symbolic approach; and the hybrid approach, which combines features of both the statistical and symbolic approaches. In this chapter I present the history and progress of NLP beginning with the introduction of the digital computer in the late 1940s, to the rise of the Internet, which resulted in a massive explosion of information and the dominance of the digital format of communication. The abundance of information stored in electronic format required computational tools for information processing, retrieval, and extraction. Because Arabic is a major world language, both Arabic speakers and international entities with interest in the Arab world have the desire to develop tools for the analysis and processing of Arabic data. Here I first present a brief description of the properties of the Arabic language that are crucial to Arabic Natural Language Processing (ANLP). Then I focus on the development of symbolic and statistical paradigms for the processing of natural language. I discuss these paradigms in the context of theoretical and practical considerations for developing Arabic machine translation systems. My conclusion is that whereas statistical approaches to ANLP seem to be more successful from a native Arabic perspective, NLP approaches that promote rigorous analysis of the Arabic language could better meet the need for Arabic information processing and also satisfy other important sociocultural needs. © 2012 Georgetown University Press.

However, the fact that students themselves, arguably novices, judged the improvement leads to concerns about the validity of peer reviewing. We measured writing quality before and after peer reviewing using Coh-Metrix, which computationally evaluates the linguistic properties of writings. Participants also evaluated the quality of their peer writings using the SWoRD system. Both measurements, particularly the computational measurement, confirmed the effectiveness of peer reviewing. In addition, the computational measures found that awareness of cohesion, including the clarity, explicitness, and concreteness of writing, improved over the course of peer reviewing. The results are discussed, along with their possible implications for the complementary roles of peer reviewing and computational writing measurements. © The Author(s) 2016.},

At the same time, practitioners working in the field of counterterrorism and security are confronted with large-scale linguistic data, and may benefit from computational methods. This article highlights the challenges and opportunities associated with applying computational linguistics in the domain of threat assessment. Four current issues are identified, namely (1) the data problem, (2) the utopia of predicting violence, (3) the base rate fallacy, and (4) the danger of closed-sourced tools. These challenges are translated into a checklist of questions that should be asked by policymakers and practitioners who (intend to) make use of tools that leverage computational linguistics for threat assessment. The ‘VISOR-P’ checklist can be used to evaluate such tools through their Validity, Indicators, Scientific Quality, Openness, Relevance and Performance. Finally, some suggestions are outlined for the furtherance of the computational linguistic threat assessment field. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Computational linguistics is an application of computer science which presents interesting challenges from the programming methodology point of view. Developing a realistic platform for the treatment of a natural language in its phonological, morphological, syntactic, and ultimately semantic aspects demands a principled modular architecture with complex cooperation between the various layers. Representing large lexical data bases, treating sophisticated phonological and morphological transformations, and processing in real time large corpuses demands fast finite-state methods toolkits. Analysing the syntactic structure, computing anaphoric relations, and dealing with the representation of information flow in dialogue understanding, demands the processing of complex constraints on graph structures, with sophisticated sharing of large non-deterministic search spaces. The talk reports on experiments in using declarative programming for the processing of the sanskrit language, in its phonological and morphological aspects. A lexicon-based morphological tagger has been designed, using an original algorithm for the analysis of euphony (the so-called sandhi process, which glues together the words of a sentence in a continuous stream of phonemes). This work, described in [2], has been implemented in a purely applicative core subset of Objective Caml [5]. The basic structures underlying this methodology have been abstracted in the Zen toolkit, distributed as free software [3]. Two complementary techniques have been put to use. Firstly, we advocate the systematic use of zippers [1] for the programming of mutable data structures in an applicative way. Zippers, or linear contexts, are related to the interaction combinators of linear logic. Secondly, a sharing functor allows the uniform minimisation of inductive data structures by representing them as shared dags. This is similar to the traditional technique of bottom-up hashing, but the computation of the keys is left to the client invoking the functor, which has two advantages: keys are computed along with the bottom-up traversal of the structure, and more importantly their computation may profit of specific statistical properties of the data at hand, optimising the buckets balancing in ways which would be unattainable by generic functions. These two complementary technologies are discussed in [4]. The talk discusses the use of these tools in the uniform representation of finite state automata and transducers as decorated lexical trees (also called tries). The trie acts as a spanning tree of the automaton search space, along a preferred deterministic skeleton. Non deterministic transitions are constructed as choice points with virtual addresses, which may be either absolute words (locating the target state by a path from the starting state) or relative differential words (bytecode of the trie zipper processor, representing the shortest path in the spanning tree of the state graph). Sharing such automata structures gives uniformly an associated equivalent minimal automaton. For instance, the lexicon is itself represented by its characteristic minimal recognizer. But this applies as well to possibly non-deterministic transducers. Thus our segmenting sandhi analyser compiles a lexicon of 120000 flexed forms with a data base of 2800 string rewrite rules into a very compact transducer of 7300 states fitting in 700KB of memory, the whole computation taking 9s on a plain PC. We believe that our experiment with functional programming applied to lexical and morphological processing of natural language is a convincing case that direct declarative programming techniques are often superior to more traditional imperative programming techniques using complex object-oriented methodologies. Our programs are very short, easy to maintain and debug, though efficient enough for real-scale use. It is our belief that this extends to other areas of Computational Linguistics, and indeed to most areas of Symbolic Computation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

A characteristic of our LKBs is that all the information, 'facts' and 'rules', stored on secondary memory, is represented using standard Artificial Intelligence techniques. Knowledge acquisition for the 'assertational' component of the fact base (episodic memory) is effected by analyzing natural language descriptions of events ('messages'): after their translation in the internal Knowledge Description Language (KDL), the messages are 'filtered' in order to eliminate irrelevant information. The storage is executed so as to optimize the organization of data, and elucidate a maximum of implicit knowledge, facilitating the subsequent query operations. A prototype of the knowledge acquisition module is actually under construction making use of the LE_LISP language. © 1990.},

	abstract = {Background: Better understanding of clinical reasoning could reduce diagnostic error linked to 8% of adverse medical events and 30% of malpractice cases. To a greater extent than the evidence-based movement, the clinical reasoning literature asserts the importance of practitioner intuition - unconscious elements of diagnostic reasoning. The study aimed to analyse the content of case report summaries in ways that explored the importance of an evidence concept, not only in relation to research literature but also intuition. Methods: The study sample comprised all 789,712 abstracts in English for case reports contained in the database PUBMED for the period 1 January 1983 to 31 December 2012. It was hypothesised that, if evidence and intuition concepts were viewed by these clinical authors as essential to understanding their case reports, they would be more likely to be found in the abstracts. Computational linguistics software was used in 1) concept mapping of 21,631,481 instances of 201 concepts, and 2) specific concept analyses examining 200 paired co-occurrences for 'evidence' and research 'literature' concepts. Results: 'Evidence' is a fundamentally patient-centred, intuitive concept linked to less common concepts about underlying processes, suspected disease mechanisms and diagnostic hunches. In contrast, the use of research literature in clinical reasoning is linked to more common reasoning concepts about specific knowledge and descriptions or presenting features of cases. 'Literature' is by far the most dominant concept, increasing in relevance since 2003, with an overall relevance of 13% versus 5% for 'evidence' which has remained static. Conclusions: The fact that the least present types of reasoning concepts relate to diagnostic hunches to do with underlying processes, such as what is suspected, raises questions about whether intuitive practitioner evidence-making, found in a constellation of dynamic, process concepts, has become less important. The study adds support to the existing corpus of research on clinical reasoning, by suggesting that intuition involves a complex constellation of concepts important to how the construct of evidence is understood. The list of concepts the study generated offers a basis for reflection on the nature of evidence in diagnostic reasoning and the importance of intuition to that reasoning. © 2015 Bell et al.; licensee BioMed Central.},

The analyses were guided by the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion, which contrasts central versus peripheral routes to persuasion. Results show these leaders utilize the central persuasion route, with more formal discourse patterns during times of crises versus non-crises. A significant interaction between leader age and armed conflict revealed interesting adaptive characteristics. Specifically, leaders' formality decreases over time in both crises and non-crises times, but this attenuation is less prominent during crisis periods.

	abstract = {The paper describes application of decision-making support, nonlinear dynamics, and computational linguistics methods to detection of information operations. The term information operation denotes a complex of information measures meant to change public opinion about a certain object or process. Dynamics of the number of publications about the target object during a given period is represented as a time series. In order to define peculiar features of such series we are using Morlet and "Mexican Hat" wavelets. Besides that, we check the correlation between the time series and the respective information operation template. In addition to the listed approaches, we are also using ?L-method based on Detrended Fluctuation Analysis. Linguistic analysis of publications on the target object is another important aspect of information operations detection. Using sentiment analysis, the emotional coloring of these publications texts is determined. For detection of sub-topics related to the basic topic, a collection of publications is used as text corpus, to which TF-IDF and visibility graphs approaches are applied for determination of keywords. The keywords defined in this way are used for clarification of queries in content-monitoring systems. Decision-making support system tools are used for decomposition of information operation topics and evaluation of efficiency rating of these topics in dynamics. During information operation topics decomposition, knowledge obtained from expert group is used. As a result of decomposition, the goal hierarchy graph of information operation topics is built. Based on this graph, recommendations for decision-makers are produced (using the method of target-oriented dynamic evaluation of alternatives) in the form of dynamic efficiency ratings of information operation topics. The recommendations produced in this way are used to evaluate the damage caused by the information operation, as well as to form the information counteractions. A concept of the information-analytical system for the detection of information operations is proposed. © 2017 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In NLP, one of the imperative and relatively less mature area is transliteration. During transliteration, issues like language identification, script specification arise in mixed script queries. To overwhelm these issues, we propose a new technique called negative bootstrapping with frequent matrix apriori for transliteration. Roman script is widely used in web search query for searching contents. The major challenge that the system face to process transliterated word is because of its existence in more than one form. The experimental evaluation has been done to check transliteration accuracy along with language identification against established methods. The paper offers a high-principled answer to handle multiple scripts used in a document leading to the problems of term matching and committing variations in spelling while searching the contents. The problem is modelled collectively with the deep-learning design and achieves significantly better results when applied to n-gram approach on the benchmark dataset. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

	abstract = {Back in 1967 the Croat linguist Ž. Muljačić introduced a fuzzy generalization of crisp Hamming distances between binary strings of length n; he wanted to show that Dalmatic, nowadays extinct, is a bridge between the Western group of Romance languages and the Eastern group, basically Romanian. Each language is described by means of n features Fi which can be present or absent, and so is encoded by a string xi,...,xn, where xi is the truth degree of the proposition feature Fi is present in the language; however, presence/absence can be ill-defined: consequentely, each xi is rather a truth degree 0;1] in a multivalued logic, a crisp value only when xi = 0 = false = absent; or xi = 1 = true = present, else strictly fuzzy. More recently Longobardi et al. [1], [2] have covered the case when a feature Fi is undefined, because logically inconsistent with truth degrees assigned to features F1,...,Fi-1 or when a feature is irrelevant because crisply absent or 'almost'° absent in both languages. The latter fact requires a Jaccard variant of the original distance. We modify the fuzzy Hamming distance, as in Muljačić case [3], [4], going to its Jaccard variant and do the same with fuzzy Hamming distinguishabilities, which are a subtle but meaningful variation of the fuzzy Hamming distance [3]. Using the technical tool of Steinhaus transforms, which serves to obtain the Jaccardlike variant of a given distance, we end up obtaining four metric distances: fuzzy distance and distinguishability without irrelevance, and their corresponding Jaccard variants with both fuzziness and irrelevance. Accordingly, we cluster in four ways Muljačić original data and comment on the differences; all this paves the way towards gauging jointly ill-defined, irrelevant but also conditionally undefined features, as in [1], [2]. The tools developed here for the first time will be used on up-to-date linguistic data within the activities of the Human Language Technologies Research Center, Bucharest University. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The paper tries to relate Wittgenstein's later writings about language with the history and content of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and in particular, its sub-area normally called Computational Linguistics, or Natural Language Processing. It argues that the shift, since 1990, from rule-driven approaches to computational language and logic, associated with traditional AI and the linguistics of Chomsky, to more statistical models of language have made those connections more plausible, in particular because there is good reason to think the latter is a better model of use than the former. What statistical language models are not, of course, are immediately plausible models of meaning. Moreover, a statistical model seeking a model of a whole language, one can now look at the World Wide Web (WWW) as an encapsulation of the usage of a whole a language, open to computational exploration, and of a kind never before available. I describe a recent empirical effort to give sense to the notion of a model of a whole language derived from the web, but whose disadvantage is that that model could never be available to a language user because of the sheer size of the WWW. The problematic issue in such an analogy (Wittgenstein and NLP) is how one can go beyond the anti-rule aspect of both to some view of how concepts can even appear to exist, whatever their true status. "A main source of our failure to understand is that we do not command a clear view of the use of our words - our grammar is lacking in this sort of perspicuity. A perspicuous representation produces just that understanding which consists in "seeing connexions". Hence the importance of finding and inventing intermediate cases. The concept of a perspicuous representation is of fundamental significance for us. It earmarks the form of account we give, the way we look at things."

	abstract = {This book provides a thorough introduction to the subfield of theoretical computer science known as grammatical inference from a computational linguistic perspective. Grammatical inference provides principled methods for developing computationally sound algorithms that learn structure from strings of symbols. The relationship to computational linguistics is natural because many research problems in computational linguistics are learning problems on words, phrases, and sentences: What algorithm can take as input some finite amount of data (for instance a corpus, annotated or otherwise) and output a system that behaves «correctly» on specific tasks? Throughout the text, the key concepts of grammatical inference are interleaved with illustrative examples drawn from problems in computational linguistics. Special attention is paid to the notion of «learning bias.» In the context of computational linguistics, such bias can be thought to reflect common (ideally universal) properties of natural languages. This bias can be incorporated either by identifying a learnable class of languages which contains the language to be learned or by using particular strategies for optimizing parameter values. Examples are drawn largely from two linguistic domains (phonology and syntax) which span major regions of the Chomsky Hierarchy (from regular to context-sensitive classes). The conclusion summarizes the major lessons and open questions that grammatical inference brings to computational linguistics. © 2011 by Morgan & Claypool.},

The approach employs both an automatic and a manual annotation of the data on several linguistic layers (including parts of speech, text structure and content). Quantitative features of the textual data are explored that are related to both the students' (domain-specific knowledge) test results and their level of academic experience. The respective analysis involves statistics of distance correlation, text categorization with respect to text types (questions and response options) as well as languages (English and German), and network analysis to assess dependencies between features. The correlation between correct test results of students and linguistic features of the verbal presentations of tests indicate to what extent language infl uences higher education test performance. It has also been found that this infl uence relates to specialized language. Thus, this integrative modeling approach contributes a test basis for a large-scale analysis of learning data and points to a number of subsequent, more detailed research questions. © Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH 2018.

In attempting to further the degree to which human subjects and computers can disagree and communicate within the context of that disagreement, i.e., “argue,” the ability to identify and classify various locutions as facts, values, or goals is crucial. I suggest that inquiry into the conceptual framework, context, the identification of pre-existing beliefs, values and goals, and the discussion of their priority will facilitate the sought after communication. Toward this end, I use the concept of ‘field’ and its identification to help distinguish the relevant categories. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001.},

However, their extensive number makes it difficult to effectively select and utilize existing handcrafted features. Coupled with the problem of inconsistent implementation across research works, there has been no categorization scheme or generally-accepted feature names. This creates unwanted confusion. Also, most existing handcrafted feature extraction libraries are not open-source or not actively maintained. As a result, a researcher often has to build such an extraction system from the ground up. We collect and categorize more than 220 popular handcrafted features grounded on past literature. Then, we conduct a correlation analysis study on several task-specific datasets and report the potential use cases of each feature. Lastly, we devise a multilingual handcrafted linguistic feature extraction system in a systematically expandable manner. We open-source our system for public access to a rich set of pre-implemented handcrafted features. Our system is coined LFTK and is the largest of its kind.

The quality of any speech synthesizer is evaluated based on its ability to resemble human voice. An intelligible text-to-speech program allows a visually impaired or a person with reading disability to familiarize a language. The text-to-speech (TTS) system will convert text into acoustic signal. Although there exist many TTS approaches, the intelligibility, naturalness, comprehensibility, and recall ability of synthesized speech is not good enough to be widely accepted by users. End-to-end speech synthesis has become a popular paradigm as a TTS can be trained using only <text, audio> pairs.

Their organization for the needs of information retrieval system has a multidimensional, multifaceted and permanent nature. It has been found that the functioning of the term as a key word in information retrieval language involves the elimination of polysemy and synonymy, which are characteristic of natural languages. However, if for descriptors as conditional normative elements unambiguity is one of the basic characteristics, then ascriptors, hierarchically subordinate to the descriptors, are capable of logical synonymy, which in turn creates conditions for improving search efficiency. The formalsemantic relations between the terms for computational linguistics as a scientific discipline in the iSybislaw information retrieval system are analyzed. Both duplicity and growing semantic differences in such terms, the need for their aspectualization are revealed. The interrelationships of the iSybislaw system with other Slavic Internet resources has been traced, which allows users to get acquainted with the state of learning a certain Slavic language in a broader temporal, genre and territorial perspective.

	abstract = {There is currently much interest in bringing together the tradition of categorial grammar, and especially the Lambek calculus, with the recent paradigm of linear logic to which it has strong ties. One active research area is designing non-commutative versions of linear logic (Abrusci, 1995; Retoré, 1993) which can be sensitive to word order while retaining the hypothetical reasoning capabilities of standard (commutative) linear logic (Dalrymple et al., 1995). Some connections between the Lambek calculus and computations in groups have long been known (van Benthem, 1986) but no serious attempt has been made to base a theory of linguistic processing solely on group structure. This paper presents such a model, and demonstrates the connection between linguistic processing and the classical algebraic notions of non-commutative free group, conjugacy, and group presentations. A grammar in this model, or G-grammar is a collection of lexical expressions which are products of logical forms, phonological forms, and inverses of those. Phrasal descriptions are obtained by forming products of lexical expressions and by cancelling contiguous elements which are inverses of each other. A G-grammar provides a symmetrical specification of the relation between a logical form and a phonological string that is neutral between parsing and generation modes. We show how the G-grammar can be "oriented" for each of the modes by reformulating the lexical expressions as rewriting rules adapted to parsing or generation, which then have strong decidability properties (inherent reversibility). We give examples showing the value of conjugacy for handling long-distance movement and quantifier scoping both in parsing and generation. The paper argues that by moving from the free monoid over a vocabulary V (standard in formal language theory) to the free group over V, deep affinities between linguistic phenomena and classical algebra come to the surface, and that the consequences of tapping the mathematical connections thus established can be considerable. © 1998 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

To this end, we analyze the five major HE reports produced in the UK over the past 2 decades (1997–2010). The proposed analytical design combines semantic mapping, natural language processing (NLP), and critical discourse analysis to identify the key actors in the sector, the nature of their agency, and changing roles. Despite more rosy accounts of social mobility and democracy in the UK offered by commentators such as Mandler (2020), we argue that higher educational policies in the UK have progressively shifted towards a neoliberal meritocratic paradigm established through: (a) the construction of a conceptual level playing field in the domain of education; and (b) its mobilization as a legitimizing basis of neoliberal meritocracy that selects “effort” as a discriminating variable. Accordingly, we argue that by assuming ontological equality between actors as a hegemonic truth, neoliberal meritocracy both constitutes and legitimates the culture of the new capitalism, and the role of higher education policies in the UK in this. © 2022 The Authors.

The explosion in the amount of text data from various sources in the context of the big data and 4.0 industrial revolution era demands innovative automatic text summarization techniques, formerly thought unattainable, to be accomplished in an ever more digital world. This chapter focuses on a sub-task of ATS, namely automatically generated summaries evaluation (AGSE). It proposes a cognitive and explainable approach of AGSE. The proposed model is the computational version of the Kintsch model of reading comprehension. It was tested and compared to Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE): a standard approach to automatically evaluate generated summaries. Conducted experiments show that our approach's scores are highly positively correlated to the state-of-the-art ROUGE ones. This research's salient outcome is that it proposes a cognitive and explainable model of AGSE, and it pushes toward cognitive natural language processing. It also demonstrates how cognitive psychology can be used for an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approach to justify an AGSE model's scores. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

	abstract = {Researches in Computational Linguistics (CL) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have been increasingly dissociated from each other. Empirical techniques in NLP show good performances in some tasks when large amount of data (with annotation) are available. However, in order for these techniques to be adapted easily to new text types or domains, or for similar techniques to be applied to more complex tasks such as text entailment than POS taggers, parsers, etc., rational understanding of language is required. Engineering techniques have to be underpinned by scientific understanding. In this paper, taking grammar in CL and parsing in NLP as an example, we will discuss how to re-integrate these two research disciplines. Research results of our group on parsing are presented to show how grammar in CL is used as the backbone of a parser. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

We shall explain how the processes of information selection and interpretation that are inherent in the presentation of data— whether this is done by computers or by people— can compromise the objectivity and truthfulness of the information presented; and also that sometimes falsehoods make sense because they are in the best interest of the hearer and/or speaker.

Over the last five years, more and more Italian Universities have introduced CL courses into their Humanities curricula, making available on-line teaching materials, tutorials and language engineering software that appear to supply the lack of offer from traditional Italian publishing houses.

Starting from a corpus-based survey on the definition and modification of concepts in German court verdicts we are currently working out a detailed description of the linguistic structures and semantic mechanisms involved. Based on this we want to develop tools that automatically recognize and process portions of verdicts that contain definitions. The resulting system will support the corpus-based extension of (hand-made) top-level legal ontologies and the update of legal terminological knowledge bases with regard to new jurisdiction.

The application of verbal communication in robotics aims to reach a natural human-like interaction with robots. In this study, we investigated how salient terms related to verbal communication in robotics have evolved over the years, what are the topics that recur in the related literature, and what are their trends. The study is based on a computational linguistic analysis conducted on a database of 7,435 scientific publications over the last 2 decades. This comprehensive dataset was extracted from the Scopus database using specific key-words. Our results show how relevant terms of verbal communication evolved, which are the main coherent topics and how they have changed over the years. We highlighted positive and negative trends for the most coherent topics and the distribution over the years for the most significant ones. In particular, verbal communication resulted in being highly relevant for social robotics.

It preserves the natural representation of the functions and the standard product and sum operations of real numbers. In the same time it requires no additional overhead for the standard dynamic programming techniques that yield the computation of a functional value.},

Existing UDDI based discovery techniques fail to recognize similarities and differences between Web service capabilities and thus greatly limit the scope of service discovery. Hence, in this paper we present a framework for discovering the vast amount of Web services present in Internet based on a novel semantic approach to automatically discover the most appropriate services to user requirements. Our framework is based on a natural language query to facilitate usage of our implemented discovery framework. For this purpose, we first apply some computational linguistics techniques such as part-of-speech tagging and word sense disambiguation to format and extract useful semantic information from user query. Then, we propose an innovative semantic matchmaking technique based on significant concepts properties in the referenced domain ontology and we show that it improves discovery efficiency compared to a similar related work. © 2014 IEEE.},

However, these techniques have not been applied to estimate the provenance of artifacts with unknown origins. Here, we estimate the geographic origin of artifacts from the Indus Valley Civilization, applying methods commonly used in cognitive science to the Indus script. We show that these methods can accurately predict the relative locations of archeological sites on the basis of artifacts of known provenance, and we further apply these techniques to determine the most probable excavation sites of four sealings of unknown provenance. These findings suggest that inscription statistics reflect historical interactions among locations in the Indus Valley region, and they illustrate how computational methods can help localize inscribed archeological artifacts of unknown origin. The success of this method offers opportunities for the cognitive sciences in general and for computational anthropology specifically. Copyright © 2015 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.},

This chapter will discuss this wider relevance: We will consider how experimental philosophers can examine language processing in order to address questions in several different areas of philosophy. To do so, we will present the emerging research program of experimental argument analysis (EAA) that examines how automatic language processing shapes verbal reasoning – including philosophical arguments. The evidential strand of experimental philosophy uses mainly questionnaire-based methods to assess the evidentiary value of intuitive judgments that are adduced as evidence for philosophical theories and as premises for philosophical arguments. Extending this prominent strand of experimental philosophy, EAA underpins such assessments, extends the scope of the assessments, and expands the range of the empirical methods employed: EAA examines how automatic inferences that are continually made in language comprehension and production shape verbal reasoning, and draws on findings about comprehension biases that affect the contextualisation of such default inferences, in order to explain and expose fallacies. It deploys findings to assess premises and inferences from premises to conclusions, in philosophical arguments. To do so, it adapts methods from psycholinguistics and recruits methods from computational linguistics. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

On the one hand users rightly demand easy to use interfaces but on the other hand want to have access to the full flexibility and power of the functions being offered. Even though a growing number of excellent systems exist which offer convenient means to use linguistic resources and methods, they usually focus on a specific domain, as for example corpus exploration or text categorization. Architectures which address a broad scope of applications are still rare. This article introduces the eHumanities Desktop, an online system for corpus management, processing and analysis which aims at bridging the gap between powerful command line tools and intuitive user interfaces.},

In this paper we present mixed-method analyses to investigate causal influences of publication trends and behavior on the adoption, persistence, and retirement of certain research foci - methodologies, materials, and tasks that are of interest to the computational linguistics (CL) community. Our key findings highlight evidence of the transition to rapidly emerging methodologies in the research community (e.g., adoption of bidirectional LSTMs influencing the retirement of LSTMs), the persistent engagement with trending tasks and techniques (e.g., deep learning, embeddings, generative, and language models), the effect of scientist location from outside the US, e.g., China on propensity of researching languages beyond English, and the potential impact of funding for large-scale research programs. We anticipate this work to provide useful insights about publication trends and behavior and raise the awareness about the potential for causal inference in the computational linguistics and a broader scientific community. © 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Psychosis has a strong social component and often involves the experience of being affected by ‘illusory social agents’. However, this experience remains under-characterized, particularly for social agents in delusions and non-vocal hallucinations. One useful approach is a form of computational linguistics called corpus linguistics that studies texts to identify patterns of meaning encoded in both the semantics and linguistic structure of the text. Methods: Twenty people living with psychosis were recruited from community and inpatient services. They participated in open-ended interviews on their experiences of social agents in psychosis and completed a measure of psychotic symptoms. Corpus linguistics analysis was used to identify key phenomenological features of vocal and non-vocal social agents in psychosis. Results: Social agents i) are represented with varying levels of richness in participants’ experiences, ii) are attributed with different kinds of identities including physical characteristics and names, iii) are perceived to have internal states and motivations that are different from those of the participants, and iv) interact with participants in various ways including through communicative speech acts, affecting participants’ bodies, and moving through space. These representations were equally rich for agents associated with hallucinated voices and those associated with non-vocal hallucinations and delusions. Conclusions: We show that the experience of illusory social agents is a rich and complex social experience reflecting many aspects of genuine social interaction and is not solely present in auditory hallucinations, but also in delusions and non-vocal hallucinations. Practitioner Points: The experience of being affected by illusory social agents in psychosis extends beyond hallucinated voices. They are a rich and complex social experience reflecting many aspects of genuine social interaction. These are also likely to be a source of significant distress and disability. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {ObjectiveTo understand medical students' motivations for choosing neurology and how applicants conceptualize the field, as this information can be used to enhance interest in neurology and develop educational programs to help identify, support, and recruit future neurologists.BackgroundApplicants to neurology residencies submit personal statements describing themselves and their motivations. Textual analysis of personal statements has been performed in internal medicine and general surgery, but never before in neurology. We hypothesized that specific words and themes would be mentioned in residency personal statements with high frequencies indicating students' motivations.MethodsWe used computational linguistics software to assess key words and thereby study motivations, expectations, and themes present among neurology applicants. A total of 2,405 personal statements submitted over 5 years to our institution were de-identified and compiled into a database for evaluation through 3 computational linguistics software programs. We performed calculations of term frequencies (TF) and TF-inverse document frequencies and performed K-means clustering to identify unique words and common themes.ResultsSpecific disease states were discussed. For example, stroke (TF 2,178), epilepsy (TF 970), and dementia (TF 944) were referenced more often than amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (TF 220) and carpal tunnel (TF 10). The most common proper names cited were Oliver Sacks (TF 94) and Sherlock Holmes (TF 41). Common themes included fascination with the brain, interest in research, desire to help patients, early interests in neurology, continued pursuit of learning, appreciation for time with patients, family history with neurologic illness, and intellectual curiosity.ConclusionsThis first computational linguistic analysis of neurology personal statements provides understanding into medical students' motivations and interests. Ongoing subgroup and thematic analyses may inform educational strategies and enhance recruitment to our field. © American Academy of Neurology.},

	abstract = {Contemporary media is full of images that reflect traditional gender notions and stereotypes, some of which may perpetuate harmful gender representations. In an effort to highlight the occurrence of these adverse portrayals, researchers have proposed machine-learning methods to identify stereotypes in the language patterns found in character dialogues. However, not all of the harmful stereotypes are communicated just through dialogue. As a complementary approach, we present a large-scale machine-learning framework that automatically identifies character's actions from scene descriptions found in movie scripts. For this work, we collected 1.2+ million scene descriptions from 912 movie scripts, with more than 50 thousand actions and 20 thousand movie characters. Our framework allow us to study systematic gender differences in movie portrayals at a scale. We show this through a series of statistical analyses that highlight differences in gender portrayals. Our findings provide further evidence to claims from prior media studies including: (i) male characters display higher agency than female characters; (ii) female actors are more frequently the subject of gaze, and (iii) male characters are less likely to display affection. We hope that these data resources and findings help raise awareness on portrayals of character actions that reflect harmful gender stereotypes, and demonstrate novel possibilities for computational approaches in media analysis.  © 2022 Martinez et al.

This raises the question of whether linguistic principles, such as the Principle of Compositionality, still have value as modeling tools. We review the recent literature and find that while an overly strict interpretation of compositionality makes it hard to achieve broad coverage in semantic parsing tasks, compositionality is still necessary for a model to learn the correct linguistic generalizations from limited data. Reconciling both of these qualities requires the careful exploration of a novel design space; we also review some recent results that may help in this exploration.  © 2023 by the author(s).

The study also tests the effect of term-weighting schemes used for information retrieval studies in the domain area of ICR. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses computational linguistics tools to measure ICR by Indian firms in the period 2014–2019. The study developed term frequencies for 23 ICR attributes using bag-of-words methodology from the annual reports. The word counts were used to construct two distinct measures of ICR, quantity and quality, deploying different term-weighting schemes, equal weighting and the term frequency-inverted document frequency (TF-IDF) weighting, respectively. A combination of parametric and non-parametric tests has been employed to examine the different hypothesis. Findings: The quantity of ICR was found to have increased post-IFRS adoption. However, the quality of ICR had fallen significantly, which resulted in the loss of value relevance of ICR. Firms making higher disclosures but of inferior quality experienced suboptimal market returns. Variation in inter-firm ICR has reduced. Size effect and sector effect continue but have attenuated. The study acknowledges the enormous impact of term-weighting schemes, used for information retrieval studies, in the domain area of ICR. Practical implications: The study strongly adds to the momentum in favour of a formal ICR standard to improve its quality, restore its value relevance and facilitate more effective decision-making where the valuation of a firm is a critical input. The study presages the firms not to make poor-quality disclosures to avoid suboptimal stock performance. Originality/value: The study sheds light on the impact of the adoption of post-IFRS on ICR in India. The study establishes the effect of term-weighting schemes, used for linguistic studies, in the domain area of ICR and adds to the literature by explaining one of the critical reasons for the dichotomy in ICR trends. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This measure provides information regarding the uncertainty of the intended meaning of English words. Specifically, data about fifty thousand distinct words was collected from a corpus of close to six hundred million words. These data are used to generate information about word association which forms a basis for the creation of semantic graphs from which clusters are created and analyzed. The clusters identify groups of words related to the different meanings of a word and are used to calculate a set of relative probabilities for the meanings. These are in turn used to calculate the information entropy for the word, which acts as a surrogate measure of ambiguity. A genetic algorithm is used to optimally determine parameters for our formula for word association and for the graph clustering algorithm. The effectiveness of this application is demonstrated with examples from psycholinguistic research.},

In this work, we use computational linguistic models that are based on the character sequences found on the pages, inspired by work on automatic authorship attribution, as opposed to the earlier work focusing on the nature of the writing script. Our rationale is that if these two independent methods should lead to similar results, we have strong evidence for the earlier identification of the scribes in the Voynich manuscript. We carry out a machine learning experiment where the manuscript is divided into an equal number of pages for three of the five scribes. Four machine learning classifiers create models that have been trained on the classification produced in earlier work to predict a scribe for each page using character n-grams as features. The results of each classifier are analysed comparatively with one another and compared with the classification provided based on palaeographic work. The results show when the classifiers produce the same classification as earlier palaeographic work on a held-out dataset. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.},

	abstract = {Limited health literacy (HL) partially mediates health disparities. Measurement constraints, including lack of validity assessment across racial/ethnic groups and administration challenges, have undermined the field and impeded scaling of HL interventions. We employed computational linguistics to develop an automated and novel HL measure, analyzing >300,000 messages sent by >9,000 diabetes patients via a patient portal to create a Literacy Profiles. We carried out stratified analyses among White/non-Hispanics, Black/ non-Hispanics, Hispanics, and Asian/Pacific Islanders to determine if the Literacy Profile has comparable criterion and predictive validities. We discovered that criterion validity was consistently high across all groups (c-statistics 0.82–0.89). We observed consistent relation-ships across racial/ethnic groups between HL and outcomes, including communication, adherence, hypoglycemia, diabetes control, and ED utilization. While concerns have arisen regarding bias in AI, the automated Literacy Profile appears sufficiently valid across race/ ethnicity, enabling HL measurement at a scale that could improve clinical care and population health among diverse populations. © Meharry Medical College.},

	abstract = {Microsyntax is a linguistic discipline dealing with idiomatic elements whose important properties are strongly related to syntax. In a way, these elements may be viewed as transitional entities between the lexicon and the grammar, which explains why they are often underrepresented in both of these resource types: the lexicographer fails to see such elements as full-fledged lexical units, while the grammarian finds them too specific to justify the creation of individual well-developed rules. As a result, such elements are poorly covered by linguistic models used in advanced modern computational linguistic tasks like high-quality machine translation or deep semantic analysis. A possible way to mend the situation and improve the coverage and adequate treatment of microsyntactic units in linguistic resources is to develop corpora with microsyntactic annotation, closely linked to specially designed lexicons. The paper shows how this task is solved in the deeply annotated corpus of Russian, SynTagRus. © 2017 De Gruyter Open Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Computational linguistics explores how human language is interpreted automatically and then processed. Research in this area takes the logical and mathematical features of natural language and advances methods and statistical procedures for automated language processing. Slot filling and intent detection are significant modules in task-based dialogue systems. Intent detection is a critical task in any natural language understanding (NLU) system and constitutes the base of a task-based dialogue system. In order to build high-quality, real-time conversational solutions for edge gadgets, there is a demand for deploying intent-detection methods on devices. This mandates an accurate, lightweight, and fast method that effectively operates in a resource-limited environment. Earlier works have explored the usage of several machine-learning (ML) techniques for detecting intent in user queries. In this article, we propose Computational Linguistics with Deep-Learning-Based Intent Detection and Classification (CL-DLBIDC) for natural language understanding. The presented CL-DLBIDC technique receives word embedding as input and learned meaningful features to determine the probable intention of the user query. In addition, the presented CL-DLBIDC technique uses the GloVe approach. In addition, the CL-DLBIDC technique makes use of the deep learning modified neural network (DLMNN) model for intent detection and classification. For the hyperparameter tuning process, the mayfly optimization (MFO) algorithm was used in this study. The experimental analysis of the CL-DLBIDC method took place under a set of simulations, and the results were scrutinized for distinct aspects. The simulation outcomes demonstrate the significant performance of the CL-DLBIDC algorithm over other DL models. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) [4] is the combination of interfaces, protocols, and associated multimedia-related information, which enables advanced services and applications based on the human-to-device and device-to-device interactions in physical and virtual environments. The rapid growth in multimedia-on-demand traffic that refers to audio, video, and images has drastically shifted on the vision of the Internet of Things (IoT) [1, 5] from scalar to IoMT, which is an integral part of multimedia services such as real-time content delivery, online games, and video conferencing on the global Internet [3, 4]. Complementarily, Computational Linguistics (CL) [2] is an interdisciplinary research field concerned with the processing of languages by computers. Since machine translation began to emerge in the early 1970s, CL has grown and developed exponentially. Nevertheless, the combination of IoT-basedmultimedia with CL services has received less attention so far and has emerged as a newresearch paradigm for future computing applications. The future of smart IoMT devices with NLP is more important in real-time systems such as speech understanding, emotion recognition, and home automation. There are several issues and technical challenges that need attention from the research community. The rapid growth of multimedia IoT services (data abstraction, data sharing, data mining) has led the way to incorporating CL techniques to meet its requirements. This special issue presents multimedia IoT services in real-time systems and highlights the open research challenges to get advantageous use of CL.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {The technological revolution and the evolution of technology have significantly facilitated the applicability of the IoT in various domains, such as healthcare, transportation, agriculture, retail, education, and, especially, higher education, which encompasses countless areas. Petri nets can be a useful tool to model the behavior of an IoT system. The main objective of this paper was to propose, model, and analyze a complex IoT system for higher education. The system involves the integration of IoT devices for monitoring data. An educational cloud was used as a support tool through which tracking, and control actions were implemented both internally, between the cloud and entities, and externally, between the cloud and the IoT. The system was modeled using Petri nets, which are systems with discrete events, and for simulation, we used the Visual Object Net++ package. Using this application, information was obtained in real time, and it was possible to intervene with changes even in the design phase. The diagrams were easy to read and interpret, which is an advantage for the decision-making system. The general structure of the application was based on n entities, where each entity represented a higher education field. In this paper, we discuss at least three fields: economics, computational linguistics, and engineering. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Computational linguistics refers to an interdisciplinary field associated with the computational modelling of natural language and studying appropriate computational methods for linguistic questions. The number of social media users has been increasing over the last few years, which have allured researchers’ interest in scrutinizing the new kind of creative language utilized on the Internet to explore communication and human opinions in a better way. Irony and sarcasm detection is a complex task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Irony detection has inferences in advertising, sentiment analysis (SA), and opinion mining. For the last few years, irony-aware SA has gained significant computational treatment owing to the prevalence of irony in web content. Therefore, this study develops Computational Linguistics with Optimal Deep Belief Network based Irony Detection and Classification (CLODBN-IRC) model on social media. The presented CLODBN-IRC model mainly focuses on the identification and classification of irony that exists in social media. To attain this, the presented CLODBN-IRC model performs different stages of pre-processing and TF-IDF feature extraction. For irony detection and classification, the DBN model is exploited in this work. At last, the hyperparameters of the DBN model are optimally modified by improved artificial bee colony optimization (IABC) algorithm. The experimental validation of the presented CLODBN-IRC method can be tested by making use of benchmark dataset. The simulation outcomes highlight the superior outcomes of the presented CLODBN-IRC model over other approaches. © 2023 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Transliteration is the method of converting a word or text from one writing style to another. Transliteration attempts to translate the same word from one language into another. This allows the reader to reconstruct the transliterated words' original pronunciation. For faster encoding and storage, transliterated texts or words are often used in Computational Linguistics Tools like Morphological Generators and Dictionaries. Transliteration's main goal is to provide a new way of representing documents by using a foreign language or writing system. Its aim is to preserve sound or phonetic syllables. Transliteration is determined to keep the sounds of the original language. As a side benefit, readers who don't even know the source language can transcribe this to the prescribed language. Forward transliteration is the process of transliterating the source language into the recommended target language, while back transliteration is the process of converting the transliterated word back to its original state. The employment of symbols to represent speech sounds is known as phonetic transcription, linguistic writing, or pronunciation notation. In linguistic terms, transcription is the formal reproduction of the spoken language in printed language. The root may be pronouncements, voice, gestures, or previously written text in another writing form. A phonetic transcription is distinct from a 'orthographic' transcription. Using a special alphabet of phonetic symbols, the transcriber takes care of how the spoken words are sounded. The IPA is the most general. In the most generic version of generative phonology, a phonetic alphabet, such as the "International Phonetic Alphabet,"is employed. Where there are several syllables in a word, one of them would be often sounded louder. This is referred to as word stress, as well as the word or phrase is stressed.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Scholars have long established the importance of the cultural outcomes of social movements in the context of political power and representation. However, they have also acknowledged the methodological difficulties associated with studying cultural outcomes, especially when culture is manifested through linguistic practices. This paper addresses the potential for dealing with movements and culture as manifested in symbols, public discourse, narratives, and rhetoric and makes two contributions: It links the social movement literature studying culture through language with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for systematic and comprehensive cultural analysis; and introduces a state-of the-art method which provides a better understanding of language change and linguistic influence given the capacity of computational analyses to process large volumes of data for multiple actors and varied data sources during long periods of time. The paper describes the cultural influence of women organizations in Spain between 2000-2020 on issues such as gender inequalities, abortion, gender violence, prostitution, and surrogacy. Tweets and manifestos by women's organizations', as well as national press coverage of women issues and interventions by MPs in the parliamentary arena, are used to describe the advantages and limitations of the method for the study of cultural outcomes. Computational linguistics provides new possibilities for scholarly research on cultural outcomes of social movements but also shows that these methods should be accompanied by precise definitions of cultural outcomes, detailed and replicable operationalisation processes, and theoretical models that identify the mechanisms that explain the linguistic phenomena that underly cultural change. © 2021.

	abstract = {We develop a framework for modeling the context sensitivity of text interpretation. As a point of reference, we focus on the complexity of educational texts. To open up a broader basis for representing phenomena of context sensitivity, we integrate a learning theory (i.e., the Cognitive Load Theory) with a theory of discourse comprehension (i.e., the Construction Integration Model) and a theory of cognitive semantics (i.e., the theory of Conceptual Spaces). The aim is to construct measures that view text complexity as a relational attribute by analogy to the relational concept of meaning in situation semantics. To this end, we reconstruct the situation semantic notion of relational meaning from the perspective of a computationally informed cognitive semantics. The aim is to prepare the development of measurements for predicting learning outcomes in the form of positive or negative learning. This prediction ideally depends on the underlying learning material, the learner’s situational context, and knowledge retrieved from his or her long-term memory, which he or she uses to arrive at coherent mental representations of the underlying texts. Finally, our model refers to machine learning as a tool for modeling such memory content. In this way, the chapter integrates approaches from different disciplines (linguistic semantics, computational linguistics, cognitive science, and data science). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

	abstract = {A common feature of recent financial crises has been the ‘drying up’ of financial market liquidity. Increased attention, therefore, has been directed to central bank policy tools which can affect liquidity, even as policy rates approach the zero lower bound. This study examines the role of the European Central Bank (ECB) Governing Council’s communication in influencing financial market liquidity. A specialized lexicon is used to extract sentiments on (i) monetary policy and (ii) economic outlook from ECB Governing Council statements between 2006 and 2016. The analysis reveals that ECB sentiments on ‘economic outlook’ are more consequential for money market (MM) liquidity than for currency, equity and bond (CEB) liquidity. Sentiments on ‘monetary policy’ produce a statistically significant effect on CEB liquidity; with more ‘hawkish’ sentiments leading to declines in liquidity. Volatility in global financial markets, however, plays a relatively more robust role than ECB sentiments in influencing market liquidity. The results are corroborated using an alternative and more generic quantifier called the Loughran and McDonald (LM) sentiment quantifier. The specialized lexicon provides richer inferences than the LM quantifier, however, since it captures the ‘hawkishness’ or ‘dovishness’ of monetary policy tone and the ‘positivity’ or ‘negativity’ of the Governing Council’s sentiments on economic outlook. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Ontology is a convenient way of knowledge management and generates considerable interest in linguistic data management. In computational linguistics, the remarkable feature of ontologization is its automated, corpus-based character. Yet, fundamental characteristics should be preserved when attempting to develop a well-elaborated linguistic ontology. This paper seeks to address the theory of ontologization through the prism of a number of sciences, namely Philosophy, Neural sciences, Cognitive and Computational Linguistics. We undertook this study to reveal the foundations of knowledge management by means of ontology. For this purpose, philosophical thoughts about ontology have been examined and generalized. The focus has been made on the main components relevant for ontologization in other sciences. To justify this consistency, we describe several ways of ontological modelling, such as semantic framing, taxonomy, thesaurus, and multidomain graph construction. By analyzing the theory of ontologization through the prism of different sciences, we have determined the application-based requirements for automated ontology development. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	abstract = {Computational linguistics is an engineering-based scientific disci-pline. It deals with understanding written and spoken language from a computational viewpoint. Further, the domain also helps construct the artefacts that are useful in processing and producing a language either in bulk or in a dialogue setting. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in the data extraction process. It concentrates on identifying and labelling the atomic components from several texts grouped under different entities, such as organizations, people, places, and times. Further, the NER mechanism identifies and removes more types of entities as per the requirements. The significance of the NER mechanism has been well-established in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, and various research investigations have been conducted to develop novel NER methods. The conventional ways of managing the tasks range from rule-related and hand-crafted feature-related Machine Learning (ML) techniques to Deep Learning (DL) techniques. In this aspect, the current study introduces a novel Dart Games Optimizer with Hybrid Deep Learning-Driven Computational Linguistics (DGOHDL-CL) model for NER. The presented DGOHDL-CL technique aims to determine and label the atomic components from several texts as a collection of the named entities. In the presented DGOHDL-CL technique, the word embed-ding process is executed at the initial stage with the help of the word2vec model. For the NER mechanism, the Convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit (CGRU) model is employed in this work. At last, the DGO technique is used as a hyperparameter tuning strategy for the CGRU algorithm to boost the NER’s outcomes. No earlier studies integrated the DGO mechanism with the CGRU model for NER. To exhibit the superiority of the proposed DGOHDL-CL technique, a widespread simulation analysis was executed on two datasets, CoNLL-2003 and OntoNotes 5.0. The experimental outcomes establish the promising performance of the DGOHDL-CL technique over other models. © 2023, Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

Tools developed specifically for such applications which combine these methods are described in concrete examples. These examples cover creation and indexing of corpora, language processing, and computational linguistics in analysis and visualisation of text. This is followed by a discussion of the main issues and topics regarding the use of computational linguistics methods in translation practice and research, and recommendations for researchers and practitioners who use or may wish to use these methods and tools in their work. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Federico Zanettin and Christopher Rundle; individual chapters, the contributors.},

Because a computer system that analyzes natural language must be able to deal with arbitrary real-world sentences, computational semantics faces a number of specific challenges related to the coverage of semantic construction procedures, the efficient resolution of ambiguities, and the ability to compute inferences. After initial successes with logic-based methods, the mainstream paradigm in computational semantics today is to let the computer automatically learn from corpora.

	abstract = {Applying artificial intelligence to Chinese language translation in computational linguistics is of practical significance for economic boosts and cultural exchanges. In the present work, the bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network is employed to extract Chinese text features regarding the overlapping semantic roles in Chinese language translation and hard-to-converge training of high-dimensional text word vectors in text classification during translation. In addition, AlexNet is optimized to extract the local features of the text and meanwhile update and learn network parameters in the deep network. Then, the attention mechanism is introduced to build a forecasting algorithm of Chinese language translation based on BiLSTM and improved AlexNet. Last, the forecasting algorithm is simulated to validate its performance. Some state-of-the-art algorithms are selected for a comparative experiment, including long short-term memory, regions with convolutional neural network features, AlexNet, and support vector machine. Results demonstrate that the forecasting algorithm proposed here can achieve a feature identification accuracy of 90.55%, at least an improvement of 4.24% over other algorithms. In addition, it provides an area under the curve of above 90%, a training duration of about 54.21 seconds, and a test duration of about 19.07 seconds. Regarding the performance of Chinese language translation, the algorithm proposed here provides a bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) value of 28.21 on the training set, with a performance gain ratio reaching 111.55%; on the test set, its BLEU reaches 40.45, with a performance gain ratio of 129.80%. Hence, this forecasting algorithm is notably superior to other algorithms, which can enhance the machine translation performance. Through experiments, the Chinese language translation algorithm constructed here improves translation performance while ensuring a high correct identification rate, providing experimental references for the later intelligent development of Chinese language translation in computational linguistics.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {This diachronic study which implements computational linguistics approach investigates the linguistics events of modal verbs in English song lyrics across time. This study aims to identify the frequency distributions of modal verbs, and to analyze the language uses of modal verbs in the Diachronic Corpus of English Song Lyrics. Quantitative and qualitative methods of analysis were employed. First, quantitative data consisting of frequency distributions of modal verbs and collocations were produced via LancsBox. Collocational patterns are illustrated through collocation graph created via Lancsbox. Frequency distributions of modal verbs were compared to general reference corpus namely the Corpus of Contemporary American English, to generalize the findings from this study as representative of English language. The numerical data were submitted for four statistical tests of significance namely Chi-square, Mutual Information, Log-likelihood, and t-score. Second, qualitative data are consisting of corpus annotations. Corpus annotation was conducted via CLAWS for assigning part-of-speech C7 tagset to identify modal verbs. Semantic categories of modal verbs were identified via UCREL Semantic Analysis System. Findings uncovered the significantly high frequencies and uprising trend of semi modals verbs want to and wanna as compared to core modal verbs in English song lyrics from 1960s towards 1990s. These two semi modals reflect social actions, high preference for personal pronouns I and you, and carry meanings of obligation and necessity similar to core modal verb should. The aforementioned characteristics characterized English song lyrics as a spoken-like genre. © 2022 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The ongoing digitalization of educational resources and the use of the internet lead to a steady increase of potentially available learning media. However, many of the media which are used for educational purposes have not been designed specifically for teaching and learning. Usually, linguistic criteria of readability and comprehensibility as well as content-related criteria are used independently to assess and compare the quality of educational media. This also holds true for educational media used in economics. This article aims to improve the analysis of textual learning media used in economic education by drawing on threshold concepts. Threshold concepts are key terms in knowledge acquisition within a domain. From a linguistic perspective, however, threshold concepts are instances of specialized vocabularies, exhibiting particular linguistic features. In three kinds of (German) resources, namely in textbooks, in newspapers, and on Wikipedia, we investigate the distributive profiles of 63 threshold concepts identified in economics education (which have been collected from threshold concept research). We looked at the threshold concepts' frequency distribution, their compound distribution, and their network structure within the three kinds of resources. The two main findings of our analysis show that firstly, the three kinds of resources can indeed be distinguished in terms of their threshold concepts' profiles. Secondly, Wikipedia definitely shows stronger associative connections between economic threshold concepts than the other sources. We discuss the findings in relation to adequate media use for teaching and learning—not only in economic education. © Copyright © 2021 Lücking, Brückner, Abrami, Uslu and Mehler.},

	abstract = {This diachronic study aims to explore the linguistic phenomena of the verb f-word in English song lyrics across genres and time via various corpus computational tools. A specialised corpus named Diachronic Corpus of English Song Lyrics (DCOESL) consisting of Country, Pop, Rhythm and Blues (R&B), and Rock genres from the years 1960 to 2009, was built for the analysis. Linguistics analysis of English song lyrics corpus was used as the research design. Computational corpus instruments were adopted to generate data. The findings reveal that corpus computational tools it has provided an avenue for researchers to explore languages across time. Additionally, the study shows that f-word in English song lyrics experience ascending trend since the 1980s, with highest occurrences in R&B (38pmw). F-word in DCOESL has strong collocational strength with personal pronoun me (17321pmw), MI=3.442. Personal pronoun me is very significant to the node f-word, T-score=3.274. F-word in DCOESL has highest significant lexical association with f-word in the spoken register of COCA, G2COCASPOKEN=102.40, df=1, p<.0001. It exhibits that the highest occurrences of f-word in DCOESL reflects social actions and a high preference for simple present tense, and simple sentence structure. In conclusion, the computational corpus analysis of f-word in English song lyrics has found that f-word prominently co-occur with personal pronoun in simple sentence structure and in simple present tense, in order to mirror English conversational discourse. The implication of this study is English song lyrics, especially from R&B genre, are a potentially authentic corpus resource for exploring spoken English. © 2022},

	abstract = {Computational creativity is a subfield of artificial intelligence concerned with the development of programs that can produce creative output; in particular, several of these programs deal with linguistic creativity. Many computational creativity systems are modeled after, or inspired by, psychological and cognitive theories of creativity. One theory that accounts for the aesthetics of creative productions is summarized in the optimal innovation hypothesis, which claims that particular minimal modifications are more pleasurable than totally novel creations. Three systems based on this theory are presented; they creatively modify linguistic expressions with a pragmatic goal, such as attracting the attention of readers and evoking the contents of a news article or producing song parodies to help the listener remember a concept. The potential of this kind of systems is large: when paired with rich user data, they could produce creative messages based on what specific users are familiar with and achieve "personalized creativity.

Formulation attempts to make sense of why a person presents in a certain state at a certain time and context, and how that state may be best managed to enhance mental health, safety and optimal change. Inherent to the clinical need for formulation is an appreciation of the complexities, uncertainty and limits of applying theoretical concepts and symptom, diagnostic and risk categories to human experience; or attaching meaning or weight to any particular factor in an individual’s history or mental state without considering the broader biopsychosocial and cultural context. With specific reference to suicide prevention, this paper considers the need and potential for the computational linguistics community to be both cognisant of and ethically contribute to the clinical formulation process. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

For that reason, it is only appropriate to conclude that linguistic capability—the ability to understand and generate natural language—is essential in any tools that we build for cognitive assistance. Fast and superior automated solutions exist in most other competencies, including numeracy and vision, but parity in linguistic skills remains elusive [1] for many reasons. In this chapter, we seek to identify why we find ourselves here and propose an alternative approach to overcome identified deficiencies. We do not know yet if this approach is useful or effective, but we proceed to share our thoughts because the biggest risk is doing nothing. First, we review seminal work on linguistics and the structure of language. We then examine the most popular contemporary solutions, identify their drawbacks and propose alternatives to address them. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {This diachronic study explores the linguistics phenomena of the verb f-word in English song lyrics across genres and time via various corpus computational tools. This study has three chief objectives; to identify the viability of using computation tools to generate a diachronic corpus across time and genres; second, determine the frequency distributions of f-word, and finally, analyze the uses of f-word in the Diachronic Corpus of English Song Lyrics (DCOESL). Quantitative and qualitative methods were employed for this study. The data were generated and analysed via AntConc, CLAWS part-of-speech taggers and UCREL Semantic Analysis System English tagger. The frequency distributions of f-word and its collocations were then compared to reference corpora; BNC and COCA. Four statistical tests of significance namely Cm-square, Log-likelihood, Mutual Information and t-score were administered to test statistical difference within DCOESL and between the corpora. The findings reveal that corpus computational tools provide a priceless opportunity to test and challenge our existing intuition about the language. More importantly, it has provided an avenue for researchers to explore languages across time. Additionally, the study shows that f-word in English song lyrics experiences ascending trend since the 1980s, with highest occurrences in R&B. It exhibits that the highest occurrences of verb f-word reflects social actions and a high preference for simple present tense, and simple sentence structure. These features have led to a conclusion that song lyrics resemble spoken English, particularly the conversation register. © 2022 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved.},

We developed methods for the automatic detection of two behavioral paradigms, lecturing and positive language usage patterns (sentiment trajectory of conversation), that are shown to be significantly associated with patient prognosis understanding. These automated metrics associated with effective communication were incorporated into SOPHIE, and a pilot user study identified that SOPHIE was favorably reviewed by a user group of practicing physicians.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

But both approaches share a common scientific object - text -, and this chapter thus reviews several textual dimensions that have already been tackled by CL: the semantic content, its segmentation and articulations within a text, as well as text classification and clustering; the semiotic and linguistic structure of documents and conversational agent modelling; the modelling and description of subjectivity, speech acts and communicative intents; and extra-textual features of discourse. These different approaches of discourse have not yet been unified in a general framework that would allow putting discourse traditions at the center of computational linguistic concerns. However, some key points are emerging that allow to devise a work program aiming towards a detailed analysis of documents and taking into account their clustering into discourse traditions as well as the life cycles of the latter. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

We present an index of Rig Vedic verses along with the respective devata, rsi and chandas which is, in short, a digitized form of the well known Rig Vedic Anukramani. We then build several deep learning based language models from the corpus. The models are tested on a downstream classification task that predicts the devata associated with a given verse. The six classifiers we test are based on FastText, ELMo, ALBERT, Word2Vec, GloVe and RoBERTa language models pretrained on the GRETIL data. We find that RoBERTa outperforms the other models on this task and achieves an accuracy of 77.3%. © 2022 Proceedings of the Computational Sanskrit and Digital Humanities at the 18th World Sanskrit Conference.

Probability and data-driven methods have been widely used in natural language processing. The need for people to extract and retrieve information from the Internet is also increasing, and more and more researchers are trying to use computers to process content related to discourse coherence. Based on the event chain of the text semantic structure representation, this paper proposes a text semantic structure representation model, on the basis of which, text coherent resources can be used for the task of text semantic analysis. Event chain is a necessary condition for discourse coherence, which can be transformed into a computable event chain analysis problem, and can be further formalized as discourse-oriented partial dependency analysis of sentences. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.},

This paper attempts to concentrate on possibilities of this AI (artificial intelligence) subfield inasmuch it could prove helpful for blended learning. It brings possible questions which are connected to e-learning, blended learning and machine learning and its utilization in university courses. It also brings several questions of computational linguistics which could prove extremely helpful in blended learning processes in which it could bring big data analysis. These phenomena are relatively new, therefore, neglected by blended learning scholars, thus this paper brings these new ideas together and wants to present new ideas and concepts which will be utilized in blended learning area. It also suggests new approach to blended learning, coined by the term blended learning 2.0, which implements modern approaches such as computational linguistics and corpus linguistics into the utilization of e-platforms in the educational process. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Existing assessment methods of writing originality have been criticized for depending heavily on subjective scoring methods. This study attempted to investigate the use of topic analysis and semantic networks in assessing writing originality. Written material was collected from a Chinese language test administered to eighth-grade students. Two steps were performed: 1. Latent topics of essays in each writing task were identified, and essays on the same topic were treated as a refined reference group, within which an essay was to be evaluated; 2. A group of features was developed, including four categories, i.e., path distance, semantic differences, centrality, and similarity of the network drawn from each text response, which were used to quantify the differences among essays. The results show that writing originality scoring is not only related to the intrinsic characteristics of the text, but is also affected by the reference group in which it is to be evaluated. This study proves that computational linguistic features can be a predictor of originality in Chinese writing. Each feature type of the four categories can predict originality, although the effect varies across various topics. Furthermore, the feature analysis provided evidence and insights to human raters for originality scoring. © 2022 by the authors.},

This research explored the market of fake documents on the White House Market anonymous market with a computational linguistic methodology; more specifically using textometry. The textual corpus is composed of the data of the ads titles as well as the profiles of the sellers, which were analysed as traces of their online activities. We investigated how these remnants can help to answer general questions. What kinds of fake documents are sold? Can we distinguish types of sellers based on their selling activities or profiles? Can we link distinct vendors based on language trace similarities? The free software IRaMuTeQ was used to carry out the analysis. The results showed that the textometric methods have real potential in classification, highlighting the different products on the market, and grouping the sellers according to their offers. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {The article presents a study of synonymous relations in the computational linguistics terminology, the relevance of which is due to the need to streamline the corresponding terminology system. The study is focused on identifying the reasons for the presence of synonymous terms in the computational linguistics vocabulary, grouping them in accordance with classification features, analyzing their etymology, morphological nature, forms of variance and interchangeability. The systematization of the terms in question is based on the descriptive method of research. Etymological, definitive and quantitative analysis methods were also applied. As a result of the study, it was found that the main reasons for the presence of synonymous relations in the computational linguistics terminology are associated with a variety of term structure forming methods, the need to select Russian-language correspondences to terms of foreign language origin and the intensive emergence of new concepts due to the rapid development of the professional sphere of automatic processing of natural language. The authors propose a classification of computational linguistics terms-synonyms according to the type of synonymous relation, structure, morphological nature, the components number of the synonymous series, etymological characteristics. Interchangeable word combinations, their truncated verbal forms, abbreviations and syntactic variants of terms in computational linguistics are revealed. © 2021 Belgorod State National Research University.

	abstract = {Arabic computational linguistics though still relatively new is gaining pace rapidly. While the development of tools for computational linguistics in many languages has come a very long way, and progress has been achieved in creating tools for Arabic, Arabic computational linguistics are in need of much attention. It is not obvious that tools developed for, let us say, English will only need minor modifications before they can be applied to Arabic. Computational tools developed for English rely heavily on enormous work achieved in English linguistics in general, and corpus linguistics more particularly. If Arabic computational linguistics is to achieve its potential, it needs to mirror the hard work done in other languages. Researchers in Arabic computational linguistics should also fully understand the nature of the data they are working with. The present article is not a review of the field, but rather a discussion on the potential, pitfalls, and challenges of Arabic computational linguistics. We will discuss the potential of what research in this field can contribute to linguistic and pedagogical research on Arabic, we will also discuss issues related to defining what ‘Arabic (language)’ is from a linguistic point of view, the nature of the Arabic script, transcription and transliteration, and finally corpus building. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The present study seeks to explore the use of lexical chunks as metadiscourse in polylogues and has found that students can use the lexical chunks as metadisourse to perform the pragmatic functions, including endophoric marker, mitigator, filler and hedge. Through the comparison with the study of computational linguistics, it is also found that students' understanding of lexical chunk is basic, and it is reasonable to infer that students can not fully grasp the lexical chunks used in the daily communication in terms of the proper forms and the pragmatic functions, and misusing happens fairly frequently. The study highlights the significance of integrating the teaching mode which involves lexical chunk specifically in English textbooks and lectures for EFL.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Computational linguistics (CL) is the application of computer science for analysing and comprehending written and spoken languages. Recently, emotion classification and sentiment analysis (SA) are the two techniques that are mostly utilized in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field. Emotion analysis refers to the task of recognizing the attitude against a topic or target. The attitude may be polarity (negative or positive) or an emotional state such as sadness, joy, or anger. Therefore, classifying posts and opinion mining manually is a difficult task. Data subjectivity has made this issue an open problem in the domain. Therefore, this article develops a computational linguistics-based emotion detection and a classification model on social networking data (CLBEDC-SND) technique. The presented CLBEDC-SND technique investigates the recognition and classification of emotions in social networking data. To attain this, the presented CLBEDC-SND model performs different stages of data pre-processing to make it compatible for further processing. In addition, the CLBEDC-SND model undergoes vectorization and sentiment scoring process using fuzzy approach. For emotion classification, the presented CLBEDC-SND model employs extreme learning machine (ELM). Finally, the parameters of the ELM model are optimally modified by the use of the shuffled frog leaping optimization (SFLO) algorithm. The performance validation of the CLBEDC-SND model is tested using benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the better performance of the CLBEDC-SND model over other models. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Tipitaka or Pali Canon is the canonical scripture of Theravada Buddhists worldwide and is said to record the direct teachings of the historical Buddha. These texts were transmitted orally for several centuries before being recorded in written form in what is now Sri Lanka, likely around 100 BCE, in the Pali language, a Middle Indo-Aryan dialect. A strong commentarial tradition evolved in the following centuries setting forth the orthodox interpretation of these texts, generally also written in Pali. The oldest of these commentaries are now considered quasi-canonical themselves. This paper explores the application of modern computational linguistics to these Pali texts. We show that relatively simple analysis of word frequency allows us to distinguish canonical works from commentary. This builds on earlier analysis showing that the canonical texts themselves could be clustered using computational techniques to separate older and newer volumes. The success of these initial analyses suggests Pali computational linguistics will be a fruitful area for future research. © 2022 Proceedings of the Computational Sanskrit and Digital Humanities at the 18th World Sanskrit Conference.

However, one important question is what it is happening with conlang in the academic world. This paper aims to have an overall understanding of the literature on conlang research. With this we aim to give a realistic picture of the field in present days. We have implemented a computational linguistic approach, combining bibliometrics and network analysis to examine all publications available in the Scopus database. Analysing over 2300 academic publications since 1927 until 2022, we have found that Esperanto is by far the most documented conlang. Three main authors have contributed to this: Garvía R., Fiedler S., and Blanke D. The 1970s and 1980s have been the decades where the foundations of current research have been built. In terms of methodologies, language learning and experimental linguistics are the ones contributing to most to the preferred approaches of study in the field. We present the results and discuss our limitations and future work. © 2022, Universita degli Studi di Torino, Dipartimento di Lingue e Letterature Straniere e Culture Moderne. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This research discusses the implementation experiment of an automatic translation of an unstructured Natural Language Question (NLQ) into a Structured Query Language (SQL) statement. SQL is used as a Relational DataBase (RDB) interaction language with special query syntax and a computer- executable artificial language. This way, DataBase (DB) administrators or general users with little or no SQL querying abilities can perform queries on RDBs in an interactive manner. The main goal of this work is to exploit a manually written rule- based mapping constraints algorithm. This algorithm maps NLQ tokens’ semantic/syntactic information into RDB elements’ semantic roles (i.e., value, attribute) via pairing and matching means. The matching RDB elements, called “identified lexica”, are then mapped into the SQL clauses consistently for SQL generation and execution. The matching process uses a computational linguistic analysis mapping algorithm, represented in the MetaTables. This mapping algorithm proved to be efficient especially with small RDBs with an accuracy of 95% and is about 93% accurate with larger RDBS. © 2022 The Author(s)},

When compared to some of the existing methods, deep learning (DL) structures have been able to perform dominantly because of its strong learning ability. The ability of DL structures increases with respect to the complicatedness of the problem or the complicated patterns within the datasets. Structure of Deep Learning architectures are also capable of extracting more beneficial features from different datasets. This survey gives an overview about deep learning and its evolution also focusing on different DL architectures, deep learning frameworks and some of the works in Natural Language Processing where deep learning is used. The paper also focuses on some of the Natural Language Processing(NLP) tasks, where deep learning methods are achieving some headway. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary subject of computer science and linguistics, belonging to the category of applied linguistics. Its content is extensive and the boundaries of computational linguistics are vague because some linguists haven’t figured out the structure of computer science. Therefore, the scope, content and approaches of computational linguistics are reconstructed. In this paper, we consider that computational linguistics can be explored through theoretical inquiry, data resources, processing algorithms investigation and program implementation, and language practical problems can be handled by means of linguistics interpretation, mathematical models, algorithm expression and program implementation. In theoretical exploration, it is difficult to connect computer science with linguistics directly, so the philosophy and mathematics should be used to build three bridges to open the relationship between linguistics and computer science and technology and the methodology of the entire connectivity is also presented. Finally, several possible research directions are proposed by taking the most subjective field, pragmatics, in linguistics. The computational theory, community detection, compiler and software engineering are connected to pragmatics, waiting to be researched further. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Teaching, reading, writing and documentation have gone through significant transition from the normal traditional hand-to-print mode to a digital setting, whereby enthusiasts can share/disseminate their intellectuality through various audio, visual and other virtual mechanisms. Since the invention of the Phonograph in 1877, the first talking book became operational during the 1930s and the Audio Books during the 1970s. The advent of the Internet has made vast volumes of educational materials available and accessible to anyone who is on the right part of the digital divide. The volumes of such useful educational materials are so massive that one needs to develop automated tools to comprehend them in terms of their organization, structure and content. Besides the (automatic) transcription of the audio and video educational resources, a primary tool to be developed is that of an automatic Context Sensitive Dictionary (CSD) generator. This paper describes a preliminary study performed for automatically generating CSD, using the computational linguistics approach and, its performance. Specifically, this study considered educational videos available over the YouTube-the most widely used website for videos-with an ultimate aim to automatically catalog all of the material contents of the YouTube. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Almost all practitioners of natural language processing make a crucial error that also besets much of Chomsky's argument about the poverty of the stimulus in first language learning, namely that we can discover all we need to know about language by examining sufficiently large quantities of it. The error is to ignore the crucial function of language in referring to things in the real and imaginary worlds. Speakers and hearers appeal to this in many ways. Translators rely on it to provide information that they must supply in the target text but which is only implicit in the source. Reference is one of several properties of language that relate parts of a text or a discourse that may not be adjacent to one another. To the extent that linguists are concerned with how people use language for communication, they are interested in processes in people's heads and, to the extent that they are concerned with processes, they are interested in computation. It is this, rather that engineering feats like machine translation, that gives computational linguistics its special role. © Cambridge University Press 2017.},

Personal recovery - living a satisfying and contributing life along symptoms of severe mental health issues - so far has only been investigated qualitatively with structured interviews and quantitatively with standardised questionnaires with mainly English-speaking participants in Western countries. Complementary to this evidence, computational linguistic methods allow us to analyse firstperson accounts shared online in large quantities, representing unstructured settings and a more heterogeneous, multilingual population, to draw a more complete picture of the aspects and mechanisms of personal recovery in bipolar disorder. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

Shedding novel light on the phenomenon, we draw on a corpus of student-authored reflective essays and apply machine learning methods for analysis of text-as-data to examine the features and the determinants of salient themes emphasized by students in their study abroad reflections. Our analysis identifies 18 different topics spanning the domains of distinctly cultural cognition, interaction with people, physical environment, and personal change. Specifics of the experience such as duration and location, timing of reflections, and observable student characteristics including gender, major, academic performance, extracurricular involvement, and socioeconomic status are all important determinants of student’s reflections. Different factors, however, matter differently with respect to students’ emphases on particular topics, a finding indicative of the complex nature of the study abroad experience. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

Embedded in languages are cultural practices and ancient wisdom. Furthermore, there is cognitive evidence to support that learning in one’s mother tongue is easier than it is in a non-native language. Many languages of the world are close to extinction or on a rapid path to extinction. In this paper, we argue that Computational Linguistics offers practical and unprecedented opportunities for preserving and promoting all natural languages. Just as much as biologists care about the extinction of species and their impact on the environmental ecosystem, linguists, computing professionals, and society-at-large should take a similar approach to protecting and celebrating the grandeur of linguistic diversity. We outline an approach to achieving this goal for Indian languages. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.},

	abstract = {Dependency grammar is an important tool in semantic analysis of text sources. In the transition-based approach of dependency graph construction, the engine detects the special features of the source text and determines the next construction steps using a machine learning method. Traditionally, the feature set is constructed manually, and some of the features may be irrelevant or redundant. In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of two known feature reduction methods in a grammar induction problem. The first method uses variance minimization algorithm and the other works with an approach based on mutual information content. We propose also a normalized feature similarity for alternative cluster-based feature reduction approach. For the test evaluation, we use the sentence bank of UD (Universal Dependency) homepage taking examples from two different languages: English and Hungarian.

Technical instructions were gathered from publicly available, online sources and analyzed to determine their usability and adherence level to published guidelines in the engineering and in the technical communication fields. Although some organizations have established guidelines unique to their industries, analysis of the randomly-selected instruction sets shows that documents often fall short of targets associated with usability, clarity, and benefit to the audience. The performed analyses show that over fifty percent of the instructions lack compliance with at least one established guideline. Copyright © 2018 ASME.},

	abstract = {Human-scored word similarity gold-standard datasets are normally composed of word pairs with corresponding similarity scores. These datasets are popular resources for evaluating word similarity models which are the essential components for many natural language processing tasks. This paper proposes a novel multidisciplinary method for constructing and validating word similarity gold-standard datasets. The proposed method is different from the previous ones in that it introduces methods from three different disciplines, i.e., psychology, brain science and computational linguistics to validate the soundness of the constructed datasets. Specifically, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time event-related potentials experiments are incorporated to validate the word similarity datasets. Using the proposed method, we finally constructed a Chinese gold-standard word similarity dataset with 260 word pairs and showed its soundness using the interdisciplinary validating methods. It should be noted that, although the paper only focused on constructing Chinese standard dataset, the proposed method is applicable to other languages. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Since 2015, the Tilburg School of Humanities and Digital Sciences at Tilburg University has provided yearly funding for two student assistants in a Research Traineeship Program. The aim of this program is to provide the student assistants with practical research experience by allowing them to work together with two experienced researchers in a practical research project. The researchers who apply for funding in this program have to work at different departments within the school, effectively encouraging cross-departmental collaborations. Within this interdisciplinary research project, the student assistants build practical research experience by following the full research process from developing research questions to presenting and publishing results. Also, due to the interdisciplinary nature, the student assistants (as well as the supervising researchers) are confronted with different research methodologies and cross-disciplinary problems. Here, we describe one of the research traineeship projects, the problem tackled, approaches used, and results. The project proposal contained ideas on how to bridge the gap between close (focused on detail, small amounts of text) and distant reading (focused on the larger picture, large amounts of text). However, specific research questions still needed to be designed. Research questions and corresponding methodologies that combine the fields of culture studies and computational linguistics were selected after extensive discussions. As the discussions demonstrated points of terminological ambivalence, we decided to subdivide the project along disciplinary lines. This resulted in a culture studies and a computational linguistics sub-project; these were constantly aligned during the project. This led to new insights into both the culture studies and computational linguistics methodologies. Here, we focus on the problems that were encountered during the project, which can mostly be attributed to difficulties related to (discipline-specific) terminology. Based on these experiences, we also provide suggestions for future work and recommendations for similar interdisciplinary collaborations. © 2020 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The computational linguistics is now undoubtedly a well-developing and prospective field of study. As an intersection between linguistics as such and the computer science, it treats many problems of how to process the natural language as to make it applicable and easily transformative for the machines. The standard question we put ourselves when it comes to the interconnected areas of the natural language processing and the computer science, is whether we can teach a computer how to speak a natural language. The issue we will be thinking over in the paper, will be the way of treating the matter of standard computational linguistics problems we do encounter on a daily basis where it connects to the field of linguistics. In this paper, a novel approach to natural language processing by using the neural networks and object oriented approach is presented. © Copyright 2016 held by the author.},

	abstract = {As techniques in computational linguistics become more widely used in scholarship and application in diverse fields, strategies for attracting students and practitioners to this area, for collaborating across disciplinary boundaries, as well as the pedagogical approaches to teaching it, will also shift. This pedagogical concept paper reports on an educational example providing a high-level introduction of computational linguistics to students across curricular levels and disciplines. Specifically, it focuses on an interdisciplinary summer workshop in which the topic of computational natural language processing (NLP) was a key theme, illustrating the workshop's provision of exposure to computational linguistics for students in both technical and non-technical majors. Including NLP modules as a major theme could bring together students from various backgrounds, encourage intellectual curiosity beyond their respective fields of study, and foster critical thinking about modeling practices and computational epistemologies. The interdisciplinary approach provided opportunities to reach out to emerging scholars and practitioners across fields, to expose them to NLP concepts, and to let them consider the benefits of considering natural language data in their own work or in future interdisciplinary collaborations. © 2016 The Author Language and Linguistics Compass © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

The dictionary contains more than 5,400 terms of computational linguistics and it made great contributions to the development of NLP domain. In order to develop the prior achievements, more terms that occur in the past two decades are added into the expanded term bank (ETB) which includes about 13,000 English terms and the number of languages involved is also extended to seven. Now,the seven language core term bank is mostly done. The construction of ETB including the scale, source of terms and the design of the database management system is described in details in the paper. ETB will have a promoting effect on the development of computational linguistics. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an on-going Natural Language Processing (NLP) research based on Lexicon-Grammar (LG) and aimed at improving knowledge management of Cultural Heritage (CH) domain. We intend to demonstrate how our language formalization technique can be applied for both processing and populating a domain ontology. We also use NLP techniques for text extraction and mining to fill information gaps and improve access to cultural resources. The Linguistic Resources (LRs, i.e. electronic dictionaries) we built can be used in the structuring of effective Knowledge Management Systems (KMSs). In order to apply to Parts of Speech (POS) the classes and properties defined by the Conseil Interational des Musees (CIDOC) Conceptual Reference Model (CRM), we use Finite State Transducers/Automata (FSTs/FSA) and their variables built in the form of graphs. FSTs/FSA are also used for analysing corpora in order to retrieve recursive sentence structures, in which combinatorial and semantic constraints identify properties and denote relationship. Besides, FSTs/FSA are also used to match our electronic dictionary entries (ALUs, or Atomic Linguistic Units) to RDF subject, object and predicate (SKOS Core Vocabulary). This matching of linguistic data to RDF and their translation into SPARQL/SERQL path expressions allows the use ALUs to process natural-language queries.},

The computational linguistic tool, Coh-Merix, was used for analyzing the linguistic features of drafts and comments produced by 41 undergraduate students. The results of this study showed that there was similarity between drafts and comments in the measures of ambiguity, lexical diversity, and syntactic complexity, whereas there was difference in the measures of cohesion. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media.},

	abstract = {Temporality in computational linguistics and natural language processing can be considered from two aspects. One concerns the use of linguistic and philosophical theories of temporality in computational applications. The other concerns the use of computational theory in its own right to define new kinds of theories of dynamical systems including natural language and its temporal semantics. As in the case of nominal expressions in natural language, we should be careful to distinguish temporal semantics, or the question of what kinds of objects and relations temporal categories denote, from the question of temporal reference to particular times or events that the discourse context affords. It is useful to draw a further distinction within the semantics between temporal ontology, or the types of temporal entity that the theory entertains, such as instants, intervals, events, states, or whatever, temporal quantification over such entities, and the temporal relations over them which it countenances, such as priority or posteriority, causal dependence, and the like. This article examines computational linguistics, focusing on temporal semantics, and also considers ontologies, quantifiers, relations, and temporal reference. © 2012 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

	abstract = {Term management in Brazil has been greatly facilitated over the past fifteen years thanks to progress made in computer and corpus linguistics, in particular the development of IT tools for processing Portuguese. This environment has contributed to the remarkable development of descriptive terminology based on actual linguistic description, exploiting the new possibilities previously unattainable opened up by access to large-scale corpora which enable the linguist to observe and describe recurrent linguistic phenomena systematically. To exemplify the new term management practices being developed in Brazil today, this article presents the current program of the Group for studies and research in terminology of the Federal University of São Carlos (GETerm), which has been developing computer-based tools since 1999. The methodology of the work corresponding to the various stages in terminology management is presented, focusing on the IT environment known as e-Termos, developed in-house. This environment brings together a set of collaborative linguistic tools linked to a modular structure dedicated to terminological activities such as corpus management, semi-automatic term extraction, preparing and publishing term records, drawing the architecture and organisation of conceptual charts (ontologies), writing definitions of terms, publishing and disseminating articles. Há mais ou menos uma década, observa-se a direta interferência, nas atividades terminográficas desenvolvidas no Brasil, dos avanços em Linguística Computacional, Linguística de Corpus e o desenvolvimento de ferramentas computacionais voltadas para o processamento do português. Nesse sentido, a terminologia descritiva de base linguística passa a ter um amplo desenvolvimento, já que a possibilidade de lidar com grandes corpora permite a observação e descrição de fenômenos linguísticos recorrentes antes impossível de perceber. Para tratar das novas práticas em terminografia, elegeu-se como cenário o Grupo de Estudos e Pesquisas em Terminologia (GETerm) que, desde 1999, desenvolve produtos terminológicos. Assim, pretende-se apresentar a metodologia de trabalho envolvida nas diversas fases da atividade terminográfica, dando relevo ao ambiente computacional denominado e-Termos, elaborado por nossa equipe de pesquisa, o qual reúne um conjunto de ferramentas linguísticas e colaborativas interligadas a uma estrutura modular dedicada às atividades terminográficas, tais como gerenciamento de corpora, extração semiautomática de termos, elaboração e edição de fichas terminológicas, arquitetura e preenchimento de mapas conceituais (ontologias), redação da definição terminológica, edição e difusão de verbetes. © 2012.

The properties of these formalizations must be well understood, and they have to do justice to both the syntactic and semantic aspects of a construction. The contributions shed light on this view from the perspectives of theoretical linguistics (semantics, syntax), automata theory, and computational and mathematical linguistics. © Akademie Verlag GmbH, Berlin 2010.

	abstract = {The advent and exponential development of the World Wide Web has led to an increasing availability of unstructured knowledge and distributed information sources, meeting general public requirements that are hardly addressed by other more traditional information channels. This trend has concurrently raised a considerable interest in the application of Computational Linguistics (CL) methodologies to document access and retrieval, as they offer the unprecedented opportunity to make the subjective, user- centred information demands of Net citizens meet the ever changing and heterogeneous information flow of the web. Over the last five years, more and more Italian Universities have introduced CL courses into their Humanities curricula, making available on-line teaching materials, tutorials and language engineering software that appear to supply the lack of offer from traditional Italian publishing houses. In this paper, we consider in some detail the role played by this type of Grey Literature in bringing up a wider and increasingly more aware community of web users in Italy.},

	abstract = {Given the prominence of finite-state techniques in natural language processing, toolkits are required that can provide finite-state capability for applications in this domain. For example, work in the context of Multi-Agent Speech Recognition requires such finite-state capability. In particular, an interface is required both for processing finite-state representations and for automatically acquiring such representations. The finite-state representations are the traditional finite-state machines together with their stochastic equivalents. The representations are specified in XML which is chosen both for clarity and for reusability and portability across different platforms and applications. Motivated by these requirements this paper presents a Finite-State Machine Hierarchy. The hierarchy is an extendible object-oriented inheritance tree where each class in the hierarchy represents a particular finite-state machine. The hierarchy has been used to deliver the required interfaces with support for XML marked up machine structures. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

The pioneering work in the 1950s and 1960s by Ferenc Papp, the reverse alphabetized Dictionary of the Hungarian Language, laid the foundations of a tradition of analysing large textual corpora. Along this path, current work on the Historical Dictionary of Hungarian by J. Pajzs and F. Papp uses statistical approaches for morphological disambiguation. In a comprehensive work by T. Váradi, a large corpus of spoken Hungarian is precessed by methods of computational linguistics. The paper also discusses linguistic approaches to two programming languages: B. Hollósy employs FoxPro in educational and academic settings for the presentation and analysis of large amounts of linguistic data, and G. Alberti uses a PROLOG implementation to represent and verify a linguistic theory of minimal syntax and maximal lexicon. © 1999 Oxford University Press.},

	abstract = {Evaluation of natural language processing tools and systems must focus on two complementary aspects: first, evaluation of the accuracy of the output, and second, evaluation of the functionality of the output as embedded in an application. This paper presents evaluations of two aspects of LinkIT, a tool for noun phrase identification linking, sorting and filtering. LinkIT [Evans 1998] uses a head sorting method [Wacholder 1998] to organize and rank simplex noun phrases (SNPs). LinkIT is to identify significant topics in domainindependent documents. The first evaluation, reported in D.K.Evans et al. 2000 compares the output of the Noun Phrase finder in LinkIT to two other systems. Issues of establishing a gold standard and criteria for matching are discussed. The second evaluation directly concerns the construction of the browsing application. We present results from Wacholder et al. 2000 on a qualitative evaluation which compares three shallow processing methods for extracting index terms, i.e., terms that can be used to model the content of documents. We analyze both quality and coverage. We discuss how experimental results such as these guide the building of an effective browsing applications.},

	abstract = {Texts in natural languages consist of words that are syntactically linked and semantically combinable-like political party, pay attention, or brick wall. Such semantically plausible combinations of two content words, which we hereafter refer to as collocations, are important knowledge in many areas of computational linguistics. We consider a lexical resource that provides such knowledge-a collocation database (CBD). Since such databases cannot be complete under any reasonable compilation procedure, we consider heuristic-based inference mechanisms that predict new plausible collocations based on the ones present in the CDB, with the help of a WordNet-like thesaurus. If an available collocation combines the entries A and B, and B is 'similar' to C, then A and C supposedly constitute a collocation of the same category. Also, we touch upon semantically induced morphological categories suiting for such inferences. Several heuristics for filtering out wrong hypotheses are also given and the experience in inferences obtained with CrossLexica CDB is briefly discussed.},
