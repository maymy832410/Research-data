The increase in volume, speed, and variety of data requires a more robust, accurate intrusion detection system capable of analyzing a huge amount of data. This work proposes the creation of an intrusion detection system using stream classifiers and three classification layers-with and without a reduction in the number of features of the records and three classifiers in parallel with a voting system. The results obtained by the proposed system are compared against other models proposed in the literature, using two datasets to validate the proposed system. In all cases, gains in accuracy of up to 18.52% and 3.55% were obtained, using the datasets NSL-KDD and CICIDS2017, respectively. Reductions in classification time up to 35.51% and 94.90% were also obtained using the NSL-KDD and CICIDS2017 datasets, respectively.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent times, a massive count of data and their increase gradually changed the significance of data security and data analysis methods for Big Data. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a scheme which analyzes and monitors data for detecting some intrusion from the system or network. Massive volume, variety, and maximum speed of data created in the network develop the data analysis procedure for detecting attacks with typical approaches highly complex. Big Data systems can be utilized in IDS for managing Big Data for accurate and effectual data analysis procedures. This study develops an Intrusion Detection Approach using Hierarchical Deep Learning-based Butterfly Optimization algorithm (ID-HDLBOA) in Big Data Platform. The presented ID-HDLBOA technique combines the concept of DL with hyperparameter tuning process. In the presented ID-HDLBOA technique, hierarchical LSTM model is provided for intrusion detection purposes. Finally, BOA is used as a hyperparameter tuning strategy for the LSTM model and it results in improvised detection efficiency. The experimental validation of the ID-HDLBOA technique is assessed on benchmark intrusion dataset and the model gives the accuracy value of 98%. Wide-ranging experiments were performed and the outcomes emphasized the supremacy of the ID-HDLBOA algorithm.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The advent of Internet of Energy (IoE) and the seamless integration of grid operators, power generators, distributors, sensors, and end users promise more efficient use of energy. However, the IoE will inherit the vulnerabilities from all of the integrated systems, and this raises concerns for trust and privacy. The evolving complexity and increased speed of network-based attacks emphasizes the need for an efficient intrusion detection system. Consequently, with the emergence of new attacks and the increasing number of signatures, traditional signature-based intrusion detection systems cannot both sift through big data and meet high network speeds. Detection performance severely deteriorates when matching hundreds of gigabits per second to the growing number of attack signatures. Given that pattern matching takes up to 60% of the overall intrusion detection time, this paper presents a new and fast software-based pattern matching system, Exscind. It proposes an exclusion-inclusion filter to preclude clean traffic before having to do expensive pattern matching. Additionally, if the traffic is malicious, the system only matches against a subset of signatures that have a high probability of being a match. We extensively evaluate the system's performance and conclude that using 6-grams signature prefix provides the best speedup and memory consumption with negligible false positives and linear scaling. We report a best-case speedup of 6.5 times for normal traffic and 1.53 times for the worst possible scenario. For best-case normal traffic, Exscind skips pattern matching for 98.36% of the packets. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {With the growing use of information technology in all life domains, hacking has become more negatively effective than ever before. Also with developing technologies, attacks numbers are growing exponentially every few months and become more sophisticated so that traditional IDS becomes inefficient detecting them. This paper proposes a solution to detect not only new threats with higher detection rate and lower false positive than already used IDS, but also it could detect collective and contextual security attacks. We achieve those results by using Networking Chatbot, a deep recurrent neural network: Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) on top of Apache Spark Framework that has an input of flow traffic and traffic aggregation and the output is a language of two words, normal or abnormal. We propose merging the concepts of language processing, contextual analysis, distributed deep learning, big data, anomaly detection of flow analysis. We propose a model that describes the network abstract normal behavior from a sequence of millions of packets within their context and analyzes them in near real-time to detect point, collective and contextual anomalies. Experiments are done on MAWI dataset, and it shows better detection rate not only than signature IDS, but also better than traditional anomaly IDS. The experiment shows lower false positive, higher detection rate and better point anomalies detection. As for prove of contextual and collective anomalies detection, we discuss our claim and the reason behind our hypothesis. But the experiment is done on random small subsets of the dataset because of hardware limitations, so we share experiment and our future vision thoughts as we wish that full prove will be done in future by other interested researchers who have better hardware infrastructure than ours. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {An intrusion detection system (IDS) is used to examine as well as analyze data for detecting intrusions in a network or system. This paper proposes an efficient intrusion detection method, named Manta Ray Political Optimization (MRPO)-based Deep maxout network. Here, the training procedure of the Deep maxout network is achieved by the proposed MRPO algorithm that is derived by integrating Manta Ray Foraging Optimization (MRFO) and Political Optimizer (PO). Initially, different subsets of data are formed by partitioning the input data and each data subset is processed by slave nodes to pre-process the data. The wrapper-based model and fisher score are used to select features such that the fusion of these features is based on Hellinger distance. With selected features, the dimensionality of data is increased using the data augmentation and based on data augmented output, and Deep maxout network is applied to detect normal and abnormal behavior. The proposed method attains maximum testing accuracy, True Positive Rate (TPR), and True Negative Rate (TNR) of 0.939, 0.943, and 0.910 by the Apache webserver dataset. When the training data is 90, the accuracy of the proposed method is 9.15%, 6.38%, 5.75%, 2.66%, 2.12%, 1.49%, 074%, 1.70%, and 4.79% higher when compared to the existing approaches namely, Hybrid deep learning, RCCRO-FCM, HHO-based DBN, CGO+ensemble SVM, Deep maxout network, PO-based Deep maxout network, MRFO- based Deep maxout network, STL-HDL, and ExpSLO enabled DRN. © 2022},

The cybersecurity is quiet on the rise threat from unauthorized; such security threats can be detected by an intrusion detection system. Thus, enhancing the intrusion detection system is main object of numbers of research and developers for monitoring the network security. Addressing challenges of big data in intrusion detection is one issue faced the researchers and developers due to dimensionality reduction in network data. In this paper, hybrid model is proposed to handle the dimensionality reduction in intrusion detection system. The genetic algorithm was applied as preprocessing steps for selecting most significant features from entire big network dataset. The genetic algorithm was applied to generate subset of relevant features from network data set for handling dimensionality reduction. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was processed the relevant features for detecting intrusion. The NSL-KDD standard data was considered to test the performance of the hybrid model. Standard evaluation metrics were employed to presents the results of hybrid model. It is concluded that the empirical results of hybrid outperformed the performance of existing systems. © 2020 International University of Sarajevo.},

	abstract = {The growing volume of data, especially in cases of imbalanced datasets, has posed significant challenges in the classification process, particularly when it comes to identifying cyberattacks on industrial control systems (ICS) networks, which have been a source of concern due to the significant destructive impact of viruses such as Slammer, worms, Stuxnet, Duqu, Seismic Net, and Flame on critical infrastructures in various countries. The key challenge is constructing the intrusion detection system (IDS) framework to deal with imbalanced datasets. Many researchers work especially on binary classification, but multi-classification is a more challenging and still active research area. To deal with the multi-class imbalanced classification problem, we outline an instance-based intrusion detection technique named ICS-IDS, for intrusion detection in ICS systems specific to SCADA networks. The developed technique consists of two core components, the data preparation component, and the detection component. The data preparation component uses the normalization, Fisher Discriminant Analysis, and k-neighbor’s method to scale the data, reduce the dimensionality, and resample the dataset, respectively. To learn the latent representations and discern harmful vectors from attacked data, the detection/recognition component leverages an efficient instance-based learner. The proposed ICS-IDS model outperforms existing attractive methods in detecting sophisticated attack vectors in ICS data, achieving 99% accuracy and 99% detection rates (DR) on an industrial network dataset. This proves the methodology's practicality for implementing security in real-world ICS networks. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Since the turn of the millennium, the volume of data has increased significantly in both industries and scientific institutions. The processing of these volumes and variety of data we are dealing with are unlikely to be accomplished with conventional software solutions. Thus, new technologies belonging to the big data processing area, able to distribute and process data in a scalable way, are integrated into classical Business Intelligence (BI) systems or replace them. Furthermore, we can benefit from big data technologies to gain knowledge about security, which can be obtained from massive databases. The paper presents a security-relevant data analysis based on the big data analytics engine Apache Spark. A prototype intrusion detection system is developed aimed at detecting data anomalies through machine learning by using the k-means algorithm for clustering analysis implemented in Sparks MLlib. The extraction of features to detect anomalies is currently challenging because the problem of detecting anomalies is not actively and exhaustively monitored. The detection of abnormal data can be effectuated by using relevant data that are already in companies’ and scientific organizations’ possession. Their interpretation and further processing in a continuous manner can sufficiently contribute to anomaly and intrusion detection. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The world interconnectivity for the Internet infrastructure has been increasing incredibly because of the enormous increase of data day by day. As most of the communications is dependent on data, the generation and use of the data have become very high so the maintenance of these data is the challenging part. For the security of data, intrusion detection system (IDS) has become a vital component. In machine learning, many IDS models proposed the previous single shallow technique used was not effective in identifying intrusion for the unique pattern. This paper introduces a machine learning model big data-based hybrid hierarchical model (BDHHM) with an Apache spark framework. BDHHM is a hybrid of two hierarchical models such as k-means and random forest tree, hence will increase the detection rate of the intrusion attack. Improved k-means and random forest tree are implemented in this work to identify the unique patterns. In deep learning, one of the artificial intelligence (AI) functions is used to process the data and comparison is made with deep learning models such as FC, CNN, and RNN. This model is effective compared to other models [14] with a true positive rate (TPR) of 96.16%, an accuracy of 95.3%, and a false positive rate of 9.1%. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {In the digital area, Internet of Things (IoT) and connected objects generate a huge quantity of data traffic which feeds big data analytic models to discover hidden patterns and detect abnormal traffic. Though IoT networks are popular and widely employed in real world applications, security in IoT networks remains a challenging problem. Conventional intrusion detection systems (IDS) cannot be employed in IoT networks owing to the limitations in resources and complexity. Therefore, this paper concentrates on the design of intelligent metaheuristic optimization based feature selection with deep learning (IMFSDL) based classification model, called IMFSDL-IDS for IoT networks. The proposed IMFSDL-IDS model involves data collection as the primary process utilizing the IoT devices and is preprocessed in two stages: data transformation and data normalization. To manage big data, Hadoop ecosystem is employed. Besides, the IMFSDL-IDS model includes a hill climbing with moth flame optimization (HCMFO) for feature subset selection to reduce the complexity and increase the overall detection efficiency. Moreover, the beetle antenna search (BAS) with variational autoencoder (VAE), called BAS-VAE technique is applied for the detection of intrusions in the feature reduced data. The BAS algorithm is integrated into the VAE to properly tune the parameters involved in it and thereby raises the classification performance. To validate the intrusion detection performance of the IMFSDL-IDS system, a set of experimentations were carried out on the standard IDS dataset and the results are investigated under distinct aspects. The resultant experimental values pointed out the betterment of the IMFSDL-IDS model over the compared models with the maximum accuracy 95.25% and 97.39% on the applied NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 dataset correspondingly. © 2022 CRL Publishing.

	abstract = {An efficient intrusion detection system (IDS) requires more than just a good machine learning (ML) classifier. However, current IDSs offer a limited perspective in handling alerts’ databases. These databases must be local and structured in order to be referenced by these IDSs, offering an obsolete approach to solve advanced attacks and intrusions on distributed systems. With the emergence of big data, cyber-attacks have become a concerning issue worldwide. In situations where data security is paramount, swiftness becomes an obligation in processing and analytic operations. In that aspect, cloud-computing services can deal efficiently with big data issues. They offer storage and distributed analysis as the tools to be featured in our paper. To handle a large scale of alert data, we propose a new distributed IDS model that solves data storage problems, combines multiple heterogeneous sources of alert data, and makes data treatment much faster than local IDSs.

The intrusions present in sustained network traffic and the massive host log event data cannot be effectively managed by conventional analytical tools, resulting in a huge number of false positives and a longer training time. This paper presents a novel technique to enhance the intrusion detection process by handling the fundamental big data complexities associated with different forms of heterogeneous security data. To achieve the earlier objective, the ensemble Support Vector Machine (SVM) is integrated with the Chaos Game Optimization (CGO) algorithm. The proposed methodology improves the intrusion classification accuracy and also identifies nine different types of attacks present in the UNSW-NB15 dataset. The efficiency of the proposed methodology is evaluated using statistical analysis and different performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, ROC curve, and confusion matrix by comparing it with different baseline models. The proposed methodology obtains an accuracy of 96.29% when compared to the chi-SVM (89.12%) and an improvement of 6.47% is noted in the proposed methodology in terms of accuracy when compared with the chi-SVM. The higher classification accuracy shows that the proposed methodology exhibit a fewer number of false positives when handling the security events in big data platforms. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

In many organizations, big data plays a major role in processing large datasets and extracts useful information from the data. Security becomes more important to all the domains and applications. Many applications use different types of security approaches to secure sensitive data from attackers. Many real-time applications are providing security for applications such as banking, trading, and e-commerce applications using better security algorithms. Processing a large amount of real-time data gets a lot of benefits to analyzing the threats in cyber-security systems. The data is collected from online real-time sources and this cyber security data consists of network information, sensor data, threat information, analysis of intrusion detection, and identifying the sensitive data in real-time applications. In this collected information various vulnerabilities and attacks are becoming prevalent and develop security solutions accordingly. In this paper, the Map-reduce-based Ensemble Intrusion Detection System (MR-EIDS) is developed to detect intruders and attackers from the real-time datasets. Two benchmark datasets are used to analyze the intrusion data. The proposed system analyzes the dataset and finds interesting patterns in the datasets.

	abstract = {With the rapid expansion of Internet services and increasing intrusion issues, conventional intrusion detection techniques cannot work well with several difficult intrusions. Though several intrusion detection methods have been introduced in the past years, developing an Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) with prevailing intrusion detection strategy is still very much desirable. Hence, a robust and effective intrusion detection approach, named RV coefficient+Exponential Sea Lion Optimization-enabled Deep Residual Network (ExpSLO-enabled DRN) using spark is devised for the intrusion detection. Here, the unique features are selected using proposed RV coefficient-based hybrid feature fusion, which is designed by the incorporation of wrapper, class-wise information gain (CIG), and Canberra distance in slave node. With the distinctive features selected, the process of data augmentation is done using oversampling for making the data more appropriate to perform the further process in the slave node. Moreover, DRN classifier is utilized for detecting the intrusions in the master node where the DRN training is done using devised ExpSLO algorithm, which is the hybridization of Exponentially Weighted Moving average (EWMA) and Sea Lion Optimization (SLnO). Furthermore, the devised method obtained better performance by considering the evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, and F-measure with the higher values of 0.8800, 0.8845, and 0.8822 based on without attacks using dataset-2. © 2022},

	abstract = {The environmental concerns, the limited availability of conventional energy sources, the integration of alternative energy sources and the increasing number of power-demanding appliances change the way electricity is generated and distributed. Smart Grid (SG) is an appealing concept, which was developed in response to the emerging issues of electricity generation and distribution. By leveraging the latest advancements of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), it offers significant benefits to energy providers, retailers and consumers. Nevertheless, SG is vulnerable to cyber attacks, that could cause critical economic and ecological consequences. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are becoming less efficient in detecting and mitigating cyberattacks, due to their limited capabilities of analyzing the exponentially increasing volume of network traffic. In this paper, we present the Secure and PrivatE smArt gRid (SPEAR) platform, which features a Big Data enabled IDS that timely detects and identifies cyber attacks against SG components. In order to validate the efficiency of the SPEAR platform regarding the protection of critical infrastructure, we installed the platform in a small wind power plant. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, information plays a significant role in the enterprise organizations. Sensitive and vital data have a key character in organizing and storing within the database. Traditional mechanisms such as encryption, access control, and authentication cannot provide a high level of confidence. The existence of Intrusion Detection Systems in the Data-Base (DB-IDS) is a necessity because enterprises awash in data often struggle to answer basic question about detecting or preventing all facet of their threat. In this paper, we propose a novel type of intrusion detection system for detecting attacks in both database transaction level and inter-transaction level (user task level) in a high-rate transaction processing. For simplicity, our model is divided into two parts; detection method at transaction level and inter-transaction level (detection with learning method, concurrently in both level). Detection method at transaction level is based on describing the expected (normal) transactions within the database applications. This is also focused on anomaly detection and used data mining to find dependency and sequence rules (the effect of spatial and temporal heterogeneity) in where inter-transaction level is used. Also, it gains advantages of a hybrid method, including specification-based detection and anomaly detection, to minimize both false positive and false negative errors. Simulation and implementation experiments in Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran (MCI) revealed the accuracy of our models. The experiment results demonstrated the true positive detection rate is higher than 0.8, and the false positive detection rate is lower than 0.1 choosing appropriate ranges for support and confidence thresholds. The experimental evaluation results show high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed system. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {While digital application infrastructure services are becoming increasingly abundant and the scale of the network continues to expand, many new network vulnerabilities and attacks (such as DoS, Botnet, and MITM) have emerged in an endless stream. The timely and accurate detection of network anomalies is of extraordinary importance for the stability of the network. Previous works designed based on deep learning have faced difficulties in their adoption in practice due to the lack of interpretability. Recently, Recurrent Neural Networks perform a superior ability to analyze high-dimensional complex network flow. However, these methods have the problems of limited parallelizability and time-consuming training, so they cannot meet the particular requirements of intrusion detection. To solve the above issues, we propose an efficient and interpretable intrusion detection scheme based on simple recurrent networks (Tab-AttSRU) to identify abnormal network traffic patterns accurately. Concretely, to obtain high-quality interpretation, we utilize model-specific feature importance and a learnable mask of TabNet for soft selection. The sequential attention mechanism is used to select the decision-making features for necessary interpretability. To realize efficient parallel computing, we combine SRU with attention mechanism to capture latent connections between traffic at different times and implement it on Spark. The performance of proposed method is assessed on the benchmark UNSW-NB15 and a real-world dataset UKM-IDS20. Experimental results have demonstrated the efficiency and interpretability of proposed method. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE.},

Such as social networks, cloud computing, and data analytics, make today possible to collect huge amounts of data. Big data has emerged as a concept at this point. Big data is the form of all the data collected from different sources such as blogs, photos, videos, log files. Therefore, big data is an important topic in many fields. However, it is not only very difficult to store big data and analyse, but also bring serious threat to the security of individual's sensitive information. This paper describes the issues surrounding big data security and privacy and provides the solution with hybrid models. Our proposed model can perform the best prediction accuracy and performance criteria. This study is based on intrusion detection and prevention systems built on big data and classifies the methods used to analyze and evaluate successes comparatively. In this paper, three different types of hybrid models are developed by 'Classification + Clustering' and 'Clustering + Classification' and multiple hyrid model (' Classification + Classification+ Clustering'). Moreover, the three hybrid models we proposed were developed using classification and clustering methods. A real world dataset from a production company in Turkey.

Smart grid is the advanced version of the traditional grid, which makes the system more efficient and self-healing. Synchrophasor is a device used in smart grids to measure the values of electric waves, voltages and current. The phasor measurement unit produces immense volume of current and voltage data that is used to monitor and control the performance of the grid. These data are huge in size and vulnerable to attacks. Intrusion Detection is a common technique for finding the intrusions in the system. In this paper, a big data framework is designed using various machine learning techniques, and intrusions are detected based on the classifications applied on the synchrophasor dataset. In this approach various machine learning techniques like deep neural networks, support vector machines, random forest, decision trees and naive bayes classifications are done for the synchrophasor dataset and the results are compared using metrics of accuracy, recall, false rate, specificity, and prediction time. Feature selection and dimensionality reduction algorithms are used to reduce the prediction time taken by the proposed approach.

Thus, the detection of intrusion is essential for smooth and secure communication in a network. In literature, many techniques have been proposed for the detection of intrusion. But those techniques either complex or fails to provide better performance in a big data application. Therefore, this paper proposed a novel Hybrid Mayfly Apriori-Intrusion Detection mechanism for effective intrusion detection in big data applications. In the proposed mechanism, Mayfly optimization based Apriori is used to detect the intrusion. Unlike conventional classification based intrusion detection, in the proposed mechanism, the network data processed to form an apriori rule based on frequent itemset. The infrequent itemset or transactions are marked as an intrusion. Comparison with established algorithms such as Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour and Support Vector Machine analyses the efficacy of the suggested mechanism. Ultimately, the proposed mechanism has shown its effectiveness by providing better results as 97% accuracy, 99% precision, and 97% recall. Thus, this mechanism is more suitable for intrusion detection in big data. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Embedded computation and compilation devices are merged together in CPS with actuators and sensors. CPS are generally spatially distributed exhibiting embryonic behavior such as cyber attacks and trafc jams resulting from system components interactions, which can be stopped when some specic components are resolved from the systems. The CPS, with qualities of universality and pervasiveness, has its effect on almost every aspect of our lives; the biggest challenge is to effectively predict the budding behaviors of the system. With the complexity of its models, it often obstructs to comprehensively test or verify their safe behavior. We can use an alternate method by equipping CPS with monitors so as to forecast the emergent behavior at run time. By using this approach, it makes CPS self-aware, allowing us to open more approaches for designing systems, which enables them to recongure dynamically to adapt different circumstances. © 2016 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Intrusion detection in industrial control systems (ICS) is crucial for maintaining secu rity in modern industries. However, the rapid growth of data generated from various sources presents significant challenges, as complex and diverse attacks continue to threaten the integrity of these systems. Traditional intrusion detection systems face limitations in effectively detecting intrusions and suffer from processing delays. To address these issues, there is an urgent need for a real-time and efficient IDS. This study introduces a novel approach to real-time intrusion detection in ICS by leveraging Cloud Computing and Big Data techniques for data fusion. By fusing mul tiple streams of data, our approach enhances intrusion detection performance, reduces false alarm rates, and produces more consistent and accurate results.

	abstract = {The rapid growth of data, the increasing number of network based applications, and the advent of the omnipresence of internet and connected devices have affected the importance of information security. Hence, a security system such as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) becomes a fundamental requirement. However, the complexity of the generated data and their huge size, plus, the variation of Cyber-attacks on: the network traffic, wireless network traffic, worldwide network traffic, connected devices and 5 G communication media, lead to hinder the IDS’s efficiency. Dealing with this huge amount of traffic is challenging and requires deploying new big data security solutions. This paper proposes an overview of intrusion detection which offers a review of IDS that deploy big data technologies and provides interesting recommendations for further study. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

	abstract = {Big data is an emerging technology which deals with wide range of data sets with sizes beyond the ability to work with software tools which is commonly used for processing of data. When we consider a huge network, we have to process a large amount of network information generated, which consists of both normal and abnormal activity logs in large volume of multi-dimensional data. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is required to monitor the network and to detect the malicious nodes and activities in the network. Massive amount of data makes it difficult to detect threats and attacks. Sequential Pattern mining may be used to identify the patterns of malicious activities which have been an emerging popular trend due to the consideration of quantities, profits and time orders of item. Here we propose a sequential pattern mining algorithm with fuzzy logic feature selection and fuzzy weighted support for huge volumes of network logs to be implemented in Apache Hadoop YARN, which solves the problem of speed and time constraints. Fuzzy logic feature selection selects important features from the feature set. Fuzzy weighted supports provide weights to the inputs and avoid multiple scans. In our simulation we use the attack log from NS-2 MANET environment and compare the proposed algorithm with the state-of-the-art sequential Pattern Mining algorithm, SPADE and Support Vector Machine with Hadoop environment. © 2017 KSII.},

Detecting real-time network attacks efficiently is challenging, especially in the resource-limited IoT setting. To enhance IoT security, intrusion detection systems using traffic features have emerged. However, these face difficulties due to varied traffic feature formats, hindering fast and accurate detection model training. To tackle accuracy issues caused by irrelevant features, a new model, LVW-MECO (LVW enhanced with multiple evaluation criteria), is introduced. It uses the LVW (Las Vegas Wrapper) algorithm with multiple evaluation criteria to identify pertinent features from IoT network data, boosting intrusion detection precision. Experimental results confirm its efficacy in addressing IoT security problems.

This steady and monumental increase in the amount, velocity and the variety of the data. This type of data is referred to as the big data, that has high variety, volume and is generated quickly. This data is difficult to process or store in the form of traditional storage mechanisms. Big data has pushed the researchers to develop innovative and resourceful techniques for its analysis as this data can hold extremely insightful knowledge that can be extracted. The big data once stored can be utilized for processing but the conventional analytical techniques are not as effective in realization of this goal. Therefore, there is a need for streamlining of the querying process to make it faster and efficient. Towards this goal the proposed methodology utilizes the parallel computation to achieve effective realization of increased efficiency.

Because of the large number of internet users, there is a large volume of network traffic, and it is the most common and challenging task to evaluate, process, and store the data. The intrusion detection systems enhance the performance of early attacks prediction and malicious attack detection. The exiting techniques met a few challenges in terms of feature selection, computational cost, accuracy, higher dimensionality, computational time and so forth. To solve these issues, we proposed a novel deep learning model for intrusion detection in big data. The data was collected from NSL-KDD, KDD-Cup99, and UNSW-NB15 datasets. Initially, the big data framework with a testbed is set up for big data analytics and processing in which the required information from a large volume is extracted. The datasets are stored in the Hadoop Distributed File System, which reduces the number of latencies in the distributed process. Finally, the intrusion detection from big data is performed using convolutional neural network-based Hybrid Whale Tabu Optimization algorithm and it effectively classifies whether the data is intrusion is non-intrusion. The proposed method provided appropriate and superior experimental results using the state-of-art method with various performance measures such as accuracy, Matthews correlation coefficient, balanced accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, and F-measures. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {With the gradual integration of Internet technology and modern industrial production, the network makes the production more intelligent and efficient at the same time, but also makes the industrial Internet face more security threats. Therefore, the protection of network information security, timely discovery and processing of abnormal access to data, to ensure the safe and robust operation of the industrial Internet is essential. Intrusion detection system, as a network security defense tool, can quickly detect and identify malicious intrusion and make emergency response. In the network intrusion detection based on data mining, the data that the intrusion detection system needs to deal with exists in the form of static data set or dynamic data stream. Intrusion detection for static data sets is easy to result in poor performance of data mining algorithm due to data redundancy, and consume a lot of computing and storage resources. Intrusion Detection (IDS) for dynamic data flow may cause the data mining model can not adapt to the dynamic change of data flow because of the limited observation samples. In order to solve the problem that data redundancy affects the effect of data mining algorithm in intrusion detection for static data sets, a data reduction method based on tree model is proposed in this paper. As a data multiprocessing method, this method combined with subgroup discovery technology to filter the data set, reduce the size of the data set, reasonably divide the data set, so as to reduce the computational cost of subsequent data mining algorithms. The experimental results of multiple data sets show that this method can effectively reduce the size of data sets. Combined with the decision tree classification algorithm, the experimental results of KDDCUP1999 intrusion detection data set show that the data set after data reduction can build a compact and smaller decision tree, and effectively improve the efficiency of decision tree classification on the basis of guaranteeing the classification accuracy. In order to solve the problem that the data mining model based on finite samples can not adapt to the data changes in the intrusion detection for dynamic data flow, this paper improves and proposes a fast decision tree classification algorithm based on probability estimation. Based on the framework of Very Fast Decision Tree (VFDT), the algorithm combined with two probabilistic correction methods, Laplace smoothing and Wilson interval mean estimation, and adjusted the attribute test conditions to select the best split attribute. The experimental results of NSL-KDD intrusion detection data set show that the improved algorithm can obtain a compact and smaller fast decision tree model, and improve the adaptability of the model to the evolution of data flow while ensuring the prediction ability of the model to data flow. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Computer security threats have always been a major concern and continue to increase in frequency and complexity. The nature and techniques of the attacks evolve rapidly over time, making their detection more difficult. Therefore the means and tools used to deal with them need to evolve at the same pace if not faster. In this paper the implementation of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) both at the Network (NIDS) and Host (HIDS) level, used at CERN, is presented. The system is currently processing in real time approximately one TB of data per day, with the final goal of coping with at least 5 TB / day. In order to accomplish this goal at first an infrastructure to collect data from sources such as system logs, web server logs and the NIDS logs has been developed making use of technologies such as Apache Flume [1] and Apache Kafka [2]. Once the data is collected it needs to be processed in search of malicious activity: the data is consumed by Apache Spark [3] jobs which compare in real time this data with known signatures of malicious activities. These are known as Indicators of Compromise (IoC). They are published by many security experts and centralized in a local Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) [4] instance. Nonetheless, detecting an intrusion is not enough. There is a need to understand what happened and why. In order to gain knowledge on the context of the detected intrusion the data is also enriched in real time when it is passing through the pipeline. For example, DNS resolution and IP geolocation are applied to it. A system generic enough to process any kind of data in JSON format is enriching the data in order to get additional context of what is happening and finally looking for indicators of compromise to detect possible intrusions, making use of the latest technologies in the Big Data ecosystem. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons.},

	abstract = {Lately, the Internet of Things (IoT) application requires millions of structured and unstructured data since it has numerous problems, such as data organization, production, and capturing. To address these shortcomings, big data analytics is the most superior technology that has to be adapted. Even though big data and IoT could make human life more convenient, those benefits come at the expense of security. To manage these kinds of threats, the intrusion detection system has been extensively applied to identify malicious network traffic, particularly once the preventive technique fails at the level of endpoint IoT devices. As cyberattacks targeting IoT have gradually become stealthy and more sophisticated, intrusion detection systems (IDS) must continually emerge to manage evolving security threats. This study devises Big Data Analytics with the Internet of Things Assisted Intrusion Detection using Modified Buffalo Optimization Algorithm with Deep Learning (IDMBOA-DL) algorithm. In the presented IDMBOA-DL model, the Hadoop MapReduce tool is exploited for managing big data. The MBOA algorithm is applied to derive an optimal subset of features from picking an optimum set of feature subsets. Finally, the sine cosine algorithm (SCA) with convolutional autoencoder (CAE) mechanism is utilized to recognize and classify the intrusions in the IoT network. A wide range of simulations was conducted to demonstrate the enhanced results of the IDMBOA-DL algorithm. The comparison outcomes emphasized the better performance of the IDMBOA-DL model over other approaches. © 2023 CRL Publishing. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Big data come with new challenges for network intrusion detection as it provides large-scale data with a variety of sophisticated attacks (e.g., malware, advanced persistent threats APTs, zero-day attacks). For that, the demand for new tools and approaches specialized in big data analytics is increasing. In addition, The false alarm rate of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) is a major concern. The majority of the existing methods for large-scale network intrusion detection reach a high false-positive rate (FPR) due to the class imbalance of large-scale intrusion datasets, which can affect the network. Subsequently, the critical challenge is to reduce FPR with the lowest decrease in true-positive rate (TPR) to retain detection quality at a feasible level. To face up to these challenges, we have proposed a new network intrusion detection system for big network intrusion based on the negative selection principle and big data frameworks. One of the promising negative selection methods of the artificial immune system (AIS) for network intrusion detection is the variable-sized detector algorithm. Unfortunately, this algorithm cannot analyze big datasets, because the generation of the radius of each detector is related to the self-space, and it will be more complex when the self-space is too big. Furthermore, the search for new detectors is done randomly, and the generated detectors do not have maximum coverage of the self and non-self-space. To confront the shortcoming of this algorithm, we have proposed an extended V-detector algorithm that is built using clonal selection and fuzzy rules, and it is implemented on Apache Spark. The proposed algorithm is scalable and more efficient when applied to large-scale imbalanced datasets. The proposed framework is implemented in a fully distributed cluster of Apache Spark workers and evaluated on the KDDcup99 benchmark dataset, on a large up-to-date dataset CICIDS2017, and on large-scale synthetic datasets. Results reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves high detection accuracy of 0.9984 and 0.9994 and very low positive rates of 0.0002 and 0.0001 with comparable detection rates for the KDDcup99 dataset and the imbalanced dataset CICIDS2017, respectively. Moreover, it improves the scalability and execution time, key for big intrusion detection analysis in real-time. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the number of people using the Internet and network services is increasing day by day. On a daily basis, a large amount of data is generated over the Internet from zeta byte to petabytes with a very high speed. On the other hand, we see more security threats on the network, the Internet, websites, and the enterprise network. Therefore, detecting intrusion in such ultra-high-speed environment in real time is a challenging task. Many intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are proposed for various types of network attacks using machine learning approaches. Most of them are unable to detect recent unknown attacks, whereas the others do not provide a real-time solution to overcome the above-mentioned challenges. Therefore, to address these problems, we propose a real-time intrusion detection system for ultra-high-speed big data environment using Hadoop implementation. The proposed system includes four-layered IDS architecture, which consists of the capturing layer, filtration and load balancing layer, processing or Hadoop layer, and the decision-making layer. Furthermore, feature selection scheme is proposed that selects nine parameters for classification using (FSR) and (BER), as well as from the analysis of DARPA datasets. In addition, five major machine learning approaches are used to evaluate the proposed system including J48, REPTree, random forest tree, conjunctive rule, support vector machine, and Naïve Bayes classifiers. Results show that among all these classifiers, REPTree and J48 are the best classifiers in terms of accuracy as well as efficiency. The proposed system architecture is evaluated with respect to accuracy in terms of true positive (TP) and false positive (FP), with respect to efficiency in terms of processing time and by comparing results with traditional techniques. It has more than 99 % TP and less than 0.001 % FP on REPTree and J48. The system has overall higher accuracy than existing IDSs with the capability to work in real time in ultra-high-speed big data environment. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The popular classification methods are implemented, tuned, and evaluated by using intrusion datasets. The objective is to select the best classifier after optimizing the hyper-parameters. We observed that the decision tree (DT) approach outperforms compared with other methods in terms of classification accuracy, fast training time, and improved average prediction rate. Therefore, it is selected as a base classifier in our proposed ensemble approach to study class imbalance. As the intrusion datasets are imbalanced, most of the classification techniques are biased toward the majority class. The misclassification rate is more in the case of the minority class. An ensemble-based method is proposed by using K-Means, RUSBoost, and DT approaches to mitigate the class imbalance problem; empirically investigate the impact of class imbalance on classification approaches' performance; and compare the result by using popular performance metrics such as Balanced Accuracy, Matthews Correlation Coefficient, and F-Measure, which are more suitable for the assessment of imbalanced datasets. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.},

Then, by adding a gradient penalty, the model's convergence speed and training stability are improved. Finally, this method enhances and expands the attack samples and verifies the dataset.

	abstract = {Intrusion detection is seen as the most promising way for computer security. It is used to protect computer networks against different types of attacks. The major problem in the literature is the classification of data into two main classes: normal and intrusion. To solve this problem, several approaches have been proposed but the problem of false alarms is still present. To provide a solution to this problem, we have proposed a new intrusion detection approach based on data fusion. The main objective of this work is to suggest an approach of data fusion-based Big Data analytics to detect intrusions; It is to build one dataset which combines various datasets and contains all the attack types. This research consists in merging the heterogeneous datasets and removing redundancy information using Big Data analytics tools: Hadoop/MapReduce and Neo4j. In the next step, machine learning algorithms are implemented for learning. The first algorithm, called SSDM (Semantically Similar Data Miner), uses fuzzy logic to generate association rules between the different item sets. The second algorithm, called K2, is a score-based greedy search algorithm for learning Bayesian networks from data. Experimentation results prove that–in both cases–data fusion contributes to having very good results. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Despite highly accurate intrusion detection schemes based on machine learning (ML) reported in the literature, changes in network traffic behavior quickly yield low accuracy rates. An intrusion detection model update is not easily feasible due to the enormous amount of network traffic to be processed in near real-time for high-speed networks, in particular, under big data settings. In this paper, we propose a new scalable long-lasting intrusion detection architecture for the processing of network content and the building of a reliable ML-based intrusion detection model. Experiments performed through the analysis of five years of network traffic, about 20 TB of data, have shown that our approach extends the lifespan of our model by up to six weeks. That occurs because the average accuracy rate of our proposal lasted eight weeks after the training phase, and traditional ones reached only two weeks after the model building. Additionally, our proposal achieves up to 10 Gbps of detection throughput in a 20-core big data processing cluster.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With vast amounts of data being generated daily and the ever increasing interconnectivity of the world's internet infrastructures, a machine learning based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) has become a vital component to protect our economic and national security. Previous shallow learning and deep learning strategies adopt the single learning model approach for intrusion detection. The single learning model approach may experience problems to understand increasingly complicated data distribution of intrusion patterns. Particularly, the single deep learning model may not be effective to capture unique patterns from intrusive attacks having a small number of samples. In order to further enhance the performance of machine learning based IDS, we propose the Big Data based Hierarchical Deep Learning System (BDHDLS). BDHDLS utilizes behavioral features and content features to understand both network traffic characteristics and information stored in the payload. Each deep learning model in the BDHDLS concentrates its efforts to learn the unique data distribution in one cluster. This strategy can increase the detection rate of intrusive attacks as compared to the previous single learning model approaches. Based on parallel training strategy and big data techniques, the model construction time of BDHDLS is reduced substantially when multiple machines are deployed.  © 2020 The author(s).},

	abstract = {Cybersecurity ventures expect that cyber-attack damage costs will rise to $11.5 billion in 2019 and that a business will fall victim to a cyber-attack every 14 seconds. Notice here that the time frame for such an event is seconds. With petabytes of data generated each day, this is a challenging task for traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Protecting sensitive information is a major concern for both businesses and governments. Therefore, the need for a real-time, large-scale and effective IDS is a must. In this work, we present a cloud-based, fault tolerant, scalable and distributed IDS that uses Apache Spark Structured Streaming and its Machine Learning library (MLlib) to detect intrusions in real-time. To demonstrate the efficacy and effectivity of this system, we implement the proposed system within Microsoft Azure Cloud, as it provides both processing power and storage capabilities. A decision tree algorithm is used to predict the nature of incoming data. For this task, the use of the MAWILab dataset as a data source will give better insights about the system capabilities against cyber-attacks. The experimental results showed a 99.95% accuracy and more than 55,175 events per second were processed by the proposed system on a small cluster. © 2018 by the authors.

Even though big data veracity is often overlooked, it is very challenging and important for an accurate and reliable mining and knowledge discovery. This paper proposes MapReduce-based belief decision trees for big data as classifiers of uncertain large-scale datasets. The proposed averaging and conjunctive classification approaches are experimented for intrusion detection on KDD’99 massive intrusion dataset.

Due to this prevalent use, cloud systems have become hot targets for attackers aiming to disrupt reliable operation of large enterprise systems. The variety of attacks launched on cloud systems, including zero-day attacks that these systems are not prepared for, call for a unified approach for real-time detection and mitigation to provide increased reliability. In this work, we propose a big data analytical approach to cloud intrusion detection, which aims to detect deviations from the normal behavior of cloud systems in near real-time and introduce measures to ensure reliable operation of the system by learning from the consequences of attack conditions. Initial experiments with recurrent neural network-based learning on a large network attack dataset demonstrate that the approach is promising to detect intrusions on cloud systems. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

This research used cloud analytics to store big dataset, preprocess data, classify and evaluate results by using Microsoft azure, which can provide the appropriate environment. Because of the growth of data volume, intrusion detection model that adopts data mining technique has been used to detect intrusion pattern. Our research used mutual information and chi-square as a feature selection technique to reduce a feature set for computation time. Then, decision forest and neural network were used to classify the attack type of intrusion by 100% KDD CUP 1999 dataset. The performance of intrusion detection was measured by the accuracy of detection rate of attack type from the evaluation process in Microsoft azure.},

	abstract = {Data security has become a very serious parf of any organizational information system. More and more threats across the Internet has evolved and capable to deceive firewall as well as antivirus software. In addition, the number of attacks become larger and become more dificult to be processed by the firewall or antivirus software. To improve the security of the system is usually done by adding Intrusion Detection System(IDS), which divided into anomaly-based detection and signature-based detection. In this research to process a huge amount of data, Big Data technique is used. Anomaly-based detection is proposed using Learning Vector Quantization Algorithm to detect the attacks. Learning Vector Quantization is a neural network technique that learn the input itself and then give the appropriate output according to the input. Modifications were made to improve test accuracy by varying the test parameters that present in LVQ. Varying the learning rate, epoch and k-fold cross validation resulted in a more efficient output. The output is obtained by calculating the value of information retrieval from the confusion matrix table from each attack classes. Principal Component Analysis technique is used along with Learning Vector Quantization to improve system performance by reducing the data dimensionality. By using 18-Principal Component, dataset successfully reduced by 47.3%, with the best Recognition Rate of 96.52% and time efficiency improvement up to 43.16%. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Analysis and modeling of the intrusion detection system is an important phenomenon for any communication network, which helps to monitor the network traffic and avoid suspicious activity in the Big Data environment. The machine learning approach for modeling the intrusion detection system requires analysis of large network data, which may include some irrelevant features resulting in unnecessary computational and analytical burden. In this article, a fuzzy and real coded chemical reaction optimization-based cluster analysis approach with feature selection is proposed for the intrusion detection system in a Big Data platform. The proposed cluster analysis model is achieved through Fuzzy C-Mean (FCM) with real-coded chemical reaction optimization, which boosts FCM to start with optimized cluster centers. Also, the use of the Flexible Mutual Information Feature Selection approach helps this model to avoid the processing of a large number of features, which drastically affects processing elements. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent times, massive quantity of data and its exponential rise have modified the significance of data security and analysis systems for Big Data. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a process which helps to monitor and analyze the data for detecting the intrusions in the network. The huge quantity, variation, and high speed of data produced in the system pose a difficulty to the conventional techniques for the detection of attacks. Big Data methods are utilized in IDS for dealing with Big Data for precise and effective data analytic processes. This paper introduces a novel feature subset selection (FSS) with deep belief network (DBN) based intrusion detection in big data environment, called FSS-DBN model. The presented model involves data preprocessing stage to improve the data quality to a certain extent. In addition, the FSS can be considered as an optimization problem and is effectively solved by the use of teaching and learning based optimization (TLBO) algorithm. Moreover, DBN model is applied for identifying the class labels (i.e. intrusions) in the network. For validating the proficient results analysis of the FSS-DBN model, an extensive set of simulations were performed and the superior performance is also highlighted with the maximum sensitivity of 0.9898, specificity of 0.9865, accuracy of 0.9854, F-score of 0.9872, and kappa of 0.9867. © 2021, Engg Journals Publications.

	abstract = {Medical information system is a comprehensive system which integrates the application of medicine, information, management, computer and other disciplines. It has been widely used in the social medical security system. But with the rapid development of Internet plus medical technology, the risk of malicious invasion has increased dramatically, which gradually exposes the problem of inadequate medical information security. Therefore, effective detection of medical information system network intrusion and timely prevention of network threats have become the focus of attention and research in this field. Intrusion detection is a common detection method in network security, it plays a very important role in network security. Traditional intrusion detection is mostly based on rule matching, statistics and other methods. With the advent of the era of big data, traditional intrusion detection can not play a good performance, especially in the face of massive, complex and unbalanced intrusion data. The privacy data access monitoring system based on virtual computing environment can monitor the access of privacy data in two levels, namely, tracking the flow of privacy data within the host and tracking the propagation of privacy data between hosts. In the host, we can customize the taint propagation rules to achieve fine-grained capture of privacy data violations in the virtual computing environment. Hence, this paper studies the medical data intrusion detection technology based on virtual data pipeline from the assurance perspectives. The model is designed and implemented with the discussions of the performance. The experimental results have proven that the proposed model is efficient. © 2021, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.},

	abstract = {The exponential growth in computer networks and network applications worldwide has been matched by a surge in cyberattacks. For this reason, datasets such as CSE-CIC-IDS2018 were created to train predictive models on network-based intrusion detection. These datasets are not meant to serve as repositories for signature-based detection systems, but rather to promote research on anomaly-based detection through various machine learning approaches. CSE-CIC-IDS2018 contains about 16,000,000 instances collected over the course of ten days. It is the most recent intrusion detection dataset that is big data, publicly available, and covers a wide range of attack types. This multi-class dataset has a class imbalance, with roughly 17% of the instances comprising attack (anomalous) traffic. Our survey work contributes several key findings. We determined that the best performance scores for each study, where available, were unexpectedly high overall, which may be due to overfitting. We also found that most of the works did not address class imbalance, the effects of which can bias results in a big data study. Lastly, we discovered that information on the data cleaning of CSE-CIC-IDS2018 was inadequate across the board, a finding that may indicate problems with reproducibility of experiments. In our survey, major research gaps have also been identified. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are extensively employed for detecting suspicious behaviors in hosts. The ability of distributed IDS solutions makes it viable to combine and handle various kinds of sensors and generate alerts to different hosts positioned in distributed platforms. However, to offer secure and feasible services in a cloud platform is an imperative issue due to the impacts of attacks. This paper devises a novel IDS framework using cloud data to counter the influence of attacks. Here, the spark architecture is employed for discovering the intrusions. The pre-processing is applied to the input data for removing artifacts and noise considering input data. Thereafter, the feature extraction and feature fusion are performed in slave nodes. The feature fusion is carried out with the proposed Exponential Squirrel Search Algorithm (ExpSSA) algorithm. The fused features are considered in a deep-stacked autoencoder (Deep SAE) for performing effective intrusion detection. The proposed ExpSSA is adapted to train Deep SAE for tuning optimum weights. The exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) and squirrel search algorithm (SSA) are combined to create the proposed ExpSSA. The proposed ExpSSA-based Deep SAE offered improved performance compared to other techniques with the highest accuracy, detection rate of 0.846, and minimal FPR. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Intrusion detection system (IDS) provides an important basis for the network defense. Due to the development of the cloud computing and social network, massive amounts of data are generated, which inevitably brings much pressure to IDS. And therefore, it becomes crucial to efficiently divide the data into different classes over big data according to data features. Moreover, we can further determine whether one is normal behavior or not based on the classes information. Although the clustering approach based on $K$ -means for IDS has been well studied, unfortunately directly using it in big data environment may suffer from inappropriateness. On the one hand, the efficiency of data clustering needs to be improved. On the other hand, differ from the classification, there is no unified evaluation indicator for clustering issue, and thus, it is necessary to study which indicator is more suitable for evaluating the clustering results of IDS. In this paper, we propose a clustering method for IDS based on Mini Batch $K$ -means combined with principal component analysis. First, a preprocessing method is proposed to digitize the strings and then the data set is normalized so as to improve the clustering efficiency. Second, the principal component analysis method is used to reduce the dimension of the processed data set aiming to further improve the clustering efficiency, and then mini batch $K$ -means method is used for data clustering. More specifically, we use $K$ -means++ to initialize the centers of cluster in order to avoid the algorithm getting into the local optimum, in addition, we choose the Calsski Harabasz indicator so that the clustering result is more easily determined. Compared with the other methods, the experimental results and the time complexity analysis show that our proposed method is effective and efficient. Above all, our proposed clustering method can be used for IDS over big data environment. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the development of big data, mobile cloud computing, cyber security issues have become more and more critical. Thus, enabling an intrusion detection method over big data in mobile cloud environment is of paramount importance. In our previous research, we proposed an approach named Mini Batch Kmeans with Principal Component Analysis (PMBKM) for big data which can effectively solve the clustering problem for intrusion detection of big data, but it needs to preset the number of clusters. The best clustering number is selected by comparing the clustering results of different clustering values multiple times. To address the above issue, we propose a new clustering method named Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering Using Hierarchies with Principal Component Analysis (PBirch) in this paper. Compared to PMBKM, the experimental results show that PBirch can obtain a good clustering result without presetting clustering values, and the clustering result can be further improved by optimizing the relevant parameters. The clustering time of PBirch decreases linearly with the increasing of the cluster numbers. Thus, the larger the number of clusters, the smaller the PBirch time cost. All in all, our proposed method can be widely used for big data in mobile cloud environment. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

	abstract = {The essential target of ‘Big Data’ technology is to provide new techniques and tools to assimilate and store large amount of generated data in a way to analyze and process it to get insights and predictions that can offer new opportunities towards the improvement of our life in different domains. In this context, ‘Big Data’ treats two essential issues: the real-time analysis issue introduced by the increasing velocity at which data is generated, and the long-term analysis issue introduced by the huge volume of stored data. To deal with these two issues, we propose in this paper a Cloud-based solution for big data analytic on Amazon Cloud operator. Our objective is to evaluate the performance of Big Data services offered regarding the volume/velocity of the processed data. The dataset we use contains information about”network connections” in approximately 5 million records with 41 features; the solution works as a network intrusion detector. It receives data records in real time from a raspberry pi node and predicts if the connection is bad (malicious intrusion or attack) or good (normal connection). The prediction model was made using a logistic regression network. We evaluate the cloud resources needed to train the machine learning model (batch processing), and to predict the new streaming data with the trained network in real time (real time processing). The solution worked very well with high accuracy and the results show that when working with Big Data in the cloud, we are mainly dealing with a cost/performance trade-off, the processing performance in term of response time for both long-term and real-time analysis can be always guaranteed once the cloud resources are well provisioned according to the needs. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

	abstract = {In order to improve the ability of computer network intrusion detection, the big data technology for computer intrusion detection was studied. This research uses big data technology to build a network intrusion detection model, using clustering algorithms, classification algorithms, and association rule algorithms in data mining to automatically identify the attack patterns in the network and quickly learn and extract the characteristics of network attacks. The experimental results show that the recognition effect of the classification algorithm is obviously better than that of the clustering algorithm and the association rule. With the increase in the proportion of abnormal commands, the accuracy rate can still be maintained at 90%. As a compromise between the classification algorithm and the clustering algorithm, the accuracy rate of the association rule algorithm is basically maintained at more than 75%. It is proved that the big data technology oriented to computer intrusion detection can effectively improve the detection ability of computer network intrusion.  © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.},

	abstract = {Intrusion detection in big data environment is very challenging task due to the huge volume and variety of data. Various machine learning and deep learning techniques have been utilized to enhance the performance of intrusion detection systems (IDS) among which the deep learning and ensemble based models have been effective and received immense interest. Still, the time for processing larger data is complex in ensemble and deep learning models. Hierarchical and distributed ensemble models like Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) can be a viable solution for the intrusion detection from larger network data. However, the distributed data blocks of big network data causes large training that is incompatible with the common processing systems under limited time. To resolve these issues, the parallel and distributed processing strategy of the MapReduce framework can be effective. This paper aims at achieving this objective by developing a hybrid deep learning and hierarchical model of ELM using MapReduce framework is proposed in this paper. The proposed MapReduce based Deep Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine (MR-DHELM) is used in the IDS to handle classification and regression of the larger network intrusion data for identifying the network intrusions. In addition to MR-DHELM, feature augmentation technique is employed using the logarithm marginal density ratios transformation to generate newer, dimension reduced and better-quality training data features to improve the classification. UNSW NB15 dataset is considered for the evaluation of the proposed MR-DHELM with feature augmentation based IDS. Experimental results illustrated that the proposed IDS model detects the network intrusions with higher accuracy of 93.97% within less training/processing time and is significantly better than the state-of-the-art models. © 2020 SERSC.},

	abstract = {In the enormous stream of network traffic, there is no way to identify which packet is benign and which is an anomaly packet. Hence, we intend to develop a new network intrusion detection model using apache-spark to improve the performance and to detect the intrusions while handling the colossal stream of network traffic in IDS. The model can detect known intrusion effectively using real-time analytics and hence identify unknown data schema compared with traditional IDS. The objective of the model addresses the following capabilities: Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) by inspecting the network traffic and examining the properties that describe the intrusion characteristics. Collaborating the vulnerability assessment with human intervention, using C.45 decision tree algorithm, optimizes pattern matching to boost detection rate. The clustered hosts are grouped based on their number of visits in an unique IP. The intrusion classifiers are developed by investigating each IP groups which reflects different properties used for prediction. The prediction model is built over Amrita Big Data Apache-Spark framework as a sequence of workflows. The above workflow is implemented in Amrita Big Data Framework (ABDF) to improve the detection time and performance, the model output provides effective results in detecting DOS attacks and port scanning attacks. ©2006-2017 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

	abstract = {In the internet era, billions of devices are connected to the network generates large volume of data and the generation rate increases exponentially every day. As the data increases, the chances for cyber attackers to exploit the data increases which results into numerous security threats to organizations and network. Fast and accurate detection of attacks in big data environment is difficult due to its volume and variety and velocity. Over a decade, numerous attack detection systems are developed using machine learning. However, most of the traditional detection systems cannot recognize the attack types specifically which reduces the detection performances and network performances. Thus, the intrusion detection model presented in this research which incorporates deep variational auto-encoder and convolutional neural network to detect intrusions. Experimentations using benchmark dataset validated the proposed model better performances over existing machine learning techniques like logistic regression, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, k-nearest neighbor, and self-scalable heuristic artificial neural network algorithms using accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score. The proposed model outperforms with a maximum precision of 97.48%, Recall of 99.52%, F1-score of 98.49% and accuracy of 98.65% over conventional intrusion detection algorithms. © 2023-IOS Press.

	abstract = {The escalating frequency and sophistication of cyber threats pose significant challenges to traditional intrusion detection methods. Signature-based misuse detection, hybrid detection, and anomaly detection, while effective in isolation, often struggle to keep pace with the ever-evolving tactics employed by attackers. This research stems from the pressing need to develop intrusion detection models that offer improved accuracy, adaptability, and robustness in the face of rapidly changing attack vectors. Our study leverages a comprehensive set of experiments conducted on diverse datasets, including N-BaIoT, NSL-KDD, and CICIDS2017. The primary focus is on the evaluation and comparison of machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and decision trees. Notably, our research culminates in the development of a hybrid intrusion detection model that combines the strengths of these algorithms. The results of our experiments indicate that the hybrid model, particularly when combining Random Forest and XGBoost, exhibits exceptional accuracy. This approach outperforms individual algorithms, achieving an accuracy rate of 97% in certain cases. We attribute this success to the ensemble learning approach, which capitalizes on the consensus of diverse classifiers. In conclusion, our research not only demonstrates the effectiveness of ensemble learning in enhancing intrusion detection but also underscores the importance of continuous adaptation in the face of evolving threats. By leveraging network traffic data, our hybrid model offers a promising avenue for bolstering intrusion classification in Big Data environments. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

As a consequence, methods and techniques have been developed for learning to cope with ever-increasing data volumes. Network intrusion detection system is a key component of cyber security systems and is widely used. Big data has posed many challenges for selecting features that have not been addressed by conventional artificial Intelligence and machine learning practices. To overcome this challenge, it is necessary to improve feature selection to present more effective methods to cope with extremely high dimensional space in big data. To address the challenges associated with feature selection in big data analytics and to foster investigations in this clan, we present an analysis of the feature selection challenges encountered by various researchers over the last decade. We propose a system for an intelligent NIDS feature selection model that allows its use as a big data engine. Intelligent NIDS features are selected using a combination of deep learning models and big data methods. Several tools are suggested for relevant data streaming and sustained storage systems in a distributed environment, which include Kafka and Hadoop (HDFS). The Intelligent NIDS Framework experimental procedure comprises a system with normal and malicious traffic, and the NIDS model would perform on cluster frameworks such as the Apache Stream Processing Cluster and the Apache Hadoop Cluster. © 2022 IEEE.},

The demand for the internet is growing every day in today's cyber world, raising concerns about network security. Big Data are a term that describes a vast volume of complicated data that is critical for evaluating network patterns and determining what has occurred in the network. Therefore, detecting attacks in a large network is challenging. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is a promising cybersecurity research field. In this paper, we proposed an efficient classification scheme for IDS, which is divided into two procedures, on the CSE-CIC-IDS-2018 dataset, data pre-processing techniques including under-sampling, feature selection, and classifier algorithms were used to assess and decide the best performing model to classify invaders. We have implemented and compared seven classifier machine learning algorithms with various criteria.

	abstract = {Although Software-defined networking (SDN) is a promising architecture that simplifies network management and control, it also faces security problems that may affect the whole network. Hence, protecting strategies, such as intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS), are in need in the SDN context. The potential of machine learning-based solutions can become the motivation of cut-edge deep learning-based intrusion detection system that can leverage the centralized control and view of the controller to secure the underlying infrastructure. However, performing additional IDPS functions in the controller, which needs to process enormous traffic amounts, can overload this component, and slow down the network. This paper introduces an approach of Big Data analysis for intrusion detection system in SDN, named BIDSDN to enhance the classification perfor-mance with a massive amount of network traffic data. Specifically, we leverage Apache Spark to deploy the distributed deep learning - based detector to reduce the processing time on complex algorithms.

	abstract = {Big data systems are expanding to support the rapidly growing needs of massive scale data analytics. To safeguard user data, the design and placement of cybersecurity systems is also evolving as organizations to increase their big data portfolios. One of several challenges presented by these changes is benchmarking real-time big data systems that use different network security architectures. This work introduces an eight-step benchmark process to evaluate big data systems in varying architectural environments. The benchmark is tested on real-time big data systems running in perimeter-based and perimeter-less network environments. Findings show that marginal I/O differences exist on distributed file systems between network architectures. However, during various types of cyber incidents such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, certain security architectures like zero trust require more system resources than perimeter-based architectures. Results illustrate the need to broaden research on optimal benchmarking and security approaches for massive scale distributed computing systems. © (2023), (Science and Information Organization).

	abstract = {The research literature on cybersecurity incident detection & response is very rich in automatic detection methodologies, in particular those based on the anomaly detection paradigm. However, very little attention has been devoted to the diagnosis ability of the methods, aimed to provide useful information on the causes of a given detected anomaly. This information is of utmost importance for the security team to reduce the time from detection to response. In this paper, we present Multivariate Big Data Analysis (MBDA), a complete intrusion detection approach based on 5 steps to effectively handle massive amounts of disparate data sources. The approach has been designed to deal with the main characteristics of Big Data, that is, the high volume, velocity and variety. The core of the approach is the Multivariate Statistical Network Monitoring (MSNM) technique proposed in a recent paper. Unlike in state of the art machine learning methodologies applied to the intrusion detection problem, when an anomaly is identified in MBDA the output of the system includes the detail of the logs of raw information associated to this anomaly, so that the security team can use this information to elucidate its root causes. MBDA is based in two open software packages available in Github: the MEDA Toolbox and the FCParser. We illustrate our approach with two case studies. The first one demonstrates the application of MBDA to semistructured sources of information, using the data from the VAST 2012 mini challenge 2. This complete case study is supplied in a virtual machine available for download. In the second case study we show the Big Data capabilities of the approach in data collected from a real network with labeled attacks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Efficient intrusion detection and analysis of the security landscape in big data environments present challenge for today’s users. Intrusion behavior can be described by provenance graphs that record the dependency relationships between intrusion processes and the infected files. Existing intrusion detection methods typically analyze and identify the anomaly either in a single provenance path or the whole provenance graph, neither of which can achieve the benefit on both detection accuracy and detection time. We propose Pagoda, a hybrid approach that takes into account the anomaly degree of both a single provenance path and the whole provenance graph. It can identify intrusion quickly if a serious compromise has been found on one path, and can further improve the detection rate by considering the behavior representation in the whole provenance graph. Pagoda uses a persistent memory database to store provenance and aggregates multiple similar items into one provenance record to maximumly reduce unnecessary I/O during the detection analysis. In addition, it encodes duplicate items in the rule database and filters noise that does not contain intrusion information. The experimental results on a wide variety of real-world applications demonstrate its performance and efficiency. © 2018 IEEE.},

However, due to the advent of big data era, massive data are generated. When dealing with large-scale data sets, most data mining algorithms suffer from a high computational burden which makes IDS much less efficient. To build an efficient IDS over big data, we propose a classification algorithm based on data clustering and data reduction. In the training stage, the training data are divided into clusters with similar size by Mini Batch K-Means algorithm, meanwhile, the center of each cluster is used as its index. Then, we select representative instances for each cluster to perform the task of data reduction and use the clusters that consist of representative instances to build a K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) detection model. In the detection stage, we sort clusters according to the distances between the test sample and cluster indexes, and obtain k nearest clusters where we find k nearest neighbors. Experimental results show that searching neighbors by cluster indexes reduces the computational complexity significantly, and classification with reduced data of representative instances not only improves the efficiency, but also maintains high accuracy.

Protecting WSNs from Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are some of the security challenges associated with WSNs. The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) should guarantee the security of the WSN services. This IDS must be able to recognize as many security risks as it can and be compatible with WSN features. In this paper, intruder node detection is accomplished using various machine learning approaches. Our work focuses on Big Data analysis based attack detection in WSN with the reduced dataset. In this work, we utilized the WSN - DS dataset. To increase classification accuracy and reduce processing complexity, feature selection is done on the dataset and a reduced dataset is created. Flooding, Blackhole, Grayhole, and TDMA attacks are the four forms of DoS attacks that are taken into consideration in this work. The parameters used to assess the attack detection are the training time to build the machine learning model, and the number of Instances that are Correctly- Classified and Incorrectly- Classified. The outcomes demonstrate that Random forest outperforms other classifiers with a high accuracy rate of 98.17% for the reduced dataset. The Bagging classifier takes less time to train the model than Random forest as well as gives an accuracy of 98% for the reduced dataset. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely used in our daily life, which enables various objects to be interconnected for data exchange, including physical devices, vehicles, and other items embedded with network connectivity. Wireless sensor network (WSN) is a vital application of IoT, providing many kinds of information among sensors, whereas such network is vulnerable to a wide range of attacks, especially insider attacks, due to its natural environment and inherent unreliable transmission. To safeguard its security, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are widely adopted in a WSN to defend against insider attacks through implementing proper trust-based mechanisms. However, in the era of big data, sensors may generate excessive information and data, which could degrade the effectiveness of trust computation. In this paper, we focus on this challenge and propose a way of combining Bayesian-based trust management with traffic sampling for wireless intrusion detection under a hierarchical structure. In the evaluation, we investigate the performance of our approach in both a simulated and a real network environment. Experimental results demonstrate that packet-based trust management would become ineffective in a heavy traffic environment, and that our approach can help lighten the burden of IDSs in handling traffic, while maintaining the detection of insider attacks. © 2013 IEEE.},

To address these issues, this paper proposes a new distributed intrusion detection model for big data based on nondestructive partitioning and balanced allocation. A data allocation strategy based on capacity and workload is introduced to achieve local load balance, and a dynamic load adjustment strategy is adopted to maintain global load balance of cluster. Moreover, data integrity is protected by using session reassemble and session partitioning. The simulation results show that the new model enjoys favorable advantages such as good load balance, higher detection rate and detection efficiency. Copyright © 2018 Tech Science Press.},

	abstract = {One of the most important parameters that hackers have always considered is obtaining information about the status of computer networks, such as hacking into databases and computer networks used in defense systems. Hence, these networks are always exposed to dangerous attacks. On the other hand, networks and hosts face a large amount of data every second. Hence, intrusion detection mechanisms have to mine this growing mountain of data for possible intrusive patterns from the security perspective. This environment and conditions make it hard to detect intrusions fast and accurately. Therefore, to identify such intrusions, it is necessary to design an intrusion detection system using big data techniques that can handle these types of data that have big data nature in detecting unauthorized access to a communication network. Therefore, this article employs a big data-aware deep learning method to design an efficient and effective Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to cope with these challenges. We designed a specific architecture of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and this model can detect complex relationships and long-term dependencies between incoming traffic packets. Through this way, we could reduce the number of false alarms and increase the accuracy of the designed intrusion detection system. Moreover, using big data analytic techniques can improve the speed of deep learning algorithms in this paper, which have low execution speed due to their high complexity. Actually, using these techniques increases the speed of execution of our complex model. Our extensive experiments are on the BigDL directly on top of the Spark framework and train with the NSL-KDD dataset. Results show that the proposed algorithm, called BDL-IDS, outperforms other IDS schemes, such as traditional machine learning and Artificial Neural Network, in terms of detection rate (20%), false alarm rate (60%), accuracy (15%), and training time (70%). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Fog computing, as the supplement of cloud computing, can provide low-latency services between mobile users and the cloud. However, fog devices may encounter security challenges as a result of the fog nodes being close to the end users and having limited computing ability. Traditional network attacks may destroy the system of fog nodes. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is a proactive security protection technology and can be used in the fog environment. Although IDS in tradition network has been well investigated, unfortunately directly using them in the fog environment may be inappropriate. Fog nodes produce massive amounts of data at all times, and, thus, enabling an IDS system over big data in the fog environment is of paramount importance. In this study, we propose an IDS system based on decision tree. Firstly, we propose a preprocessing algorithm to digitize the strings in the given dataset and then normalize the whole data, to ensure the quality of the input data so as to improve the efficiency of detection. Secondly, we use decision tree method for our IDS system, and then we compare this method with Naïve Bayesian method as well as KNN method. Both the 10% dataset and the full dataset are tested. Our proposed method not only completely detects four kinds of attacks but also enables the detection of twenty-two kinds of attacks. The experimental results show that our IDS system is effective and precise. Above all, our IDS system can be used in fog computing environment over big data. © 2018 Kai Peng et al.},

	abstract = {The ability to process large amounts of data in real time using big data analytics tools brings many advantages that can be used in intrusion detection systems. Deep learning approaches have also been increasingly used in big data analysis and intrusion detection systems in recent years. In this study, a new classification-based network attack detection system is proposed on network flow traffic generating big data. In the proposed system, a Hybrid Deep Learning (HDL) network consisting of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is used for a better intrusion detection system. In addition, data imbalance processing consisting of Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Tomek-Links sampling methods called STL was used to reduce the effects of data imbalance on system performance. In the study, PySpark providing Python support on Apache Spark platform in Google Colab environment was used. The multiclass evaluation of the model was made on the CIDDS-001 data set, and the binary classification evaluation was made on the UNS-NB15 data set. Nine different machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been compared to the proposed method. The results obtained were evaluated using the parameters of Accuracy, F-Measure, Precision, Recall, ROC Curve and Precision-Recall Curve. As a result, the proposed method has reached 99.83% accuracy in multiclass classification and 99.17% accuracy in binary classification. According to the results, the proposed method has achieved quite successful results in detecting network attacks in imbalanced data sets compared to current methods. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

How to effectively prevent CN viruses from invading other places and ensuring normal operation has become one of the current topics that need to be solved and valued urgently. With the rapid development of computer technology, CN is essential for teachers and students to study and live in school. There are a large number of information resources in the campus, various professional classrooms and other public areas for information sharing through the CN.

At the same time, security issues in networks, Internets and organizations are also continues to increase. The process of finding intrusions in such a big data environment is not easier. Different types of intrusion-detection system (IDS) have been presented for diverse kinds of networking attacks, however, many models could be identified unknown attacks. Deep learning (DL) approaches lately employed to large-scale big data analysis for effectual outcome. In this view, this paper presents a new deep learning based hyperparameter search (HPS) convolutional neural network with Bi-directional long short term memory (CBL) model called HPS-CBL for intrusion detection in big data environment. The HPS-CBL model make use of CBL technique for the identification of intrusions in the network. Since the proper tuning of hyperparameters of the CBL network is highly important, the proposed model uses improved genetic algorithm (IGA) for hyperparameter tuning. The proposed HPS-CBL is validated using a UNSW-NB15 dataset and the results are validated under diverse evaluation parameters. The obtained experimental outcome clearly stated the superior nature of the HPS-CBL model over the compared methods by attaining a maximum precision of 99.24%, recall of 98.69%, F-score of 98.97% and accuracy of 98.18% respectively. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Intrusion detection system (IDS) is a system that monitors and analyzes data to detect any intrusion in the system or network. High volume, variety and high speed of data generated in the network have made the data analysis process to detect attacks by traditional techniques very difficult. Big Data techniques are used in IDS to deal with Big Data for accurate and efficient data analysis process. This paper introduced Spark-Chi-SVM model for intrusion detection. In this model, we have used ChiSqSelector for feature selection, and built an intrusion detection model by using support vector machine (SVM) classifier on Apache Spark Big Data platform. We used KDD99 to train and test the model. In the experiment, we introduced a comparison between Chi-SVM classifier and Chi-Logistic Regression classifier.

	abstract = {The evolution of the Internet produced a large quantity of information. This makes the internet world more complex and affected by powerful attacks. In modern networks, the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) acts as a significant function for network security. The IDS can be either anomaly or signature-based behavior detection. Recently, several detection approaches have been proposed by researchers to find network intrusions. In this paper, a deep learning approach to intrusion detection using the Exponential Shuffled Shepherded Optimization Algorithm (ExpSSOA) is proposed. The proposed ExpSSOA combines the exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) and the shuffled shepherded optimization algorithm (SSOA). The proposed ExpSSOA-based Deep Maxout network for intrusion detection is examined using the MQTT-IOT-IDS2020 dataset and the Apache Web Server dataset. According to the experimental results using the Apache webserver dataset, the suggested ExpSSOA-Deep maxout network offers a better result with an accuracy of 0.883, an F-measure of 0.8768, a precision of 0.8746, and a recall of 0.8564. © 2022},

It is necessary to retain high security measures to ensure safe and trusted communication across the network. Diverse soft-computing-based methods have been devised in the past for the perfection of intrusion detection systems on host-based and host-independent systems. This chapter discusses the flow-based anomaly detector for intrusion in network by self-learning process with characteristics of bacterial forging approach. This approach handles the network-flow and attack on network traffic in an automated fashion. This approach works on host-independent systems and on stream of network rather than payload length where data behavior of flow in network is analyzed. This model provides a cataloging of attacks and resistance mechanism techniques to avoid intrusion. © 2015, IGI Global.},

However, since the amount of data has grown fast due to the emergence of big data, the performance of traditional systems designed to identify breaches has suffered several flaws. One of them, for example, is known as single-point failure; low adaptability and a high false alarm rate are also typical. Hadoop is used to detect intrusions to tackle these difficulties. The Java system is used to create a framework with a significant data flow that detects intrusions when a distributed system is built. The proposed solution employs a distributed operating system for data collection, storage, and analysis. The results indicate that external distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are recognized quickly. The single-point failure issue is overcome, alleviating the bottleneck problem of data processing ability.  © 2022 Rong Chen.},

	abstract = {Big data cybersecurity has garnered more attraction in recent years with the development of advanced machine learning and deep learning classifiers. These new classifier algorithms have significantly improved Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). In these classifiers, the performance is positively influenced by high relevant features while less relevant features negatively influence the performance. However, considering all the attributes, especially the high dimensional attributes, increases computational complications. Hence it is essential to diminish the dimensionality of the attributes to improve the classifier performance. To achieve this objective, an efficient dimensionality reduction approach is presented through the development of the Fuzzy Optimized Independent Component Analysis (FOICA) technique. The standard Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is coupled with the fuzzy entropy to transform the high dimension attributes into low dimension attributes and helps in selecting high informative low-dimensional attributes. These selected features are fed to efficient hybrid classifiers namely Hyper-heuristic Support Vector Machines (HH-SVM), Hyper-Heuristic Improved Particle Swarm Optimization based Support Vector Machines (HHIPSO-SVM) and Hyper-Heuristic Firefly Algorithm based Convolutional Neural Networks (HHFA-CNN) to classify the cybersecurity data to identify the intrusions. Experiments are conducted over two cybersecurity datasets and real-time laboratory data whose outcomes specify the supremacy of the suggested IDS model based on FOICA dimensionality reduction. © Aswanandini R., Deepa Ch., 2022.},

	abstract = {Currently, information technology is used in all the life domains. Many devices and equipment produce data and transfer them across the network. These transfers are not always secured and can contain new menaces and attacks invisible by the current security tools. Moreover, the large amount and variety of the exchanged data make the identification of the intrusions more difficult in terms of detection time. To solve these issues, we suggest in this paper, a new approach based on storing the large amount and variety of network traffic data employing big data techniques, and analyzing these data with machine learning algorithms, in a distributed and parallel way, in order to detect new hidden intrusions with less processing time. According to the results of the experiments, the detection accuracy of the machine learning methods reaches up to 99.9%, and their processing time has been reduced considerably by applying them in a parallel and distributed way, which proves that our proposed model is very effective for the detection of new hidden intrusions. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

	abstract = {The volume of network and Internet traffic is expanding daily, with data being created at the zettabyte to petabyte scale at an exceptionally high rate. These can be characterized as big data, because they are large in volume, variety, velocity, and veracity. Security threats to networks, the Internet, websites, and organizations are growing alongside this growth in usage. Detecting intrusions in such a big data environment is difficult. Various intrusion-detection systems (IDSs) using artificial intelligence or machine learning have been proposed for different types of network attacks, but most of these systems either cannot recognize unknown attacks or cannot respond to such attacks in real time. Deep learning models, recently applied to large-scale big data analysis, have shown remarkable performance in general but have not been examined for detection of intrusions in a big data environment. This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning model to efficiently detect network intrusions based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a weight-dropped, long short-term memory (WDLSTM) network. We use the deep CNN to extract meaningful features from IDS big data and WDLSTM to retain long-term dependencies among extracted features to prevent overfitting on recurrent connections. The proposed hybrid method was compared with traditional approaches in terms of performance on a publicly available dataset, demonstrating its satisfactory performance. © 2019},
